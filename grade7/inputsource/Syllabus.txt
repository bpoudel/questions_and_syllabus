Sampling and Inference
Understanding Samples
1. Populations and samples
Name: Populations and samples
Description: This fundamental skill introduces students to the core concepts of population and sample in statistics. Students will learn to differentiate between the entire group of interest (the population) and a subset of that group from which data is collected (the sample). This distinction is critical for understanding statistical inference.
Core Example Questions:
In a study of all students in a school, if you survey 50 students, what is the population and what is the sample?
A company wants to know the average height of trees in a forest. They measure 100 trees. Identify the population and the sample.
Explain why a census (surveying everyone) might be considered a sample of itself.
Difficulty: Introductory
Common pitfalls:
Confusing the definitions of population and sample.
Incorrectly identifying the complete group of interest.
Thinking the sample must be a large percentage of the population.

3. Identify representative, random, and biased samples
Name: Identify representative, random, and biased samples
Description: This skill introduces critical characteristics of samples. Students will distinguish between representative samples (accurately reflecting the characteristics of the population), random samples (every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected), and biased samples (favoring certain outcomes or groups). They will understand the implications of these characteristics for drawing valid inferences.
Core Example Questions:
A principal wants to know what students think about the cafeteria food. She surveys every 10th student entering the school. Is this a random sample? Is it likely representative?
A TV station asks viewers to call in and vote for their favorite show. Is this sample likely biased? Why or why not?

Description: This skill focuses on using dot plots as a visual tool to evaluate whether a sample is representative of a given population. Students will compare the distribution, center, and spread of data in a sample's dot plot to what is known or expected about the population's characteristics, identifying if the sample seems to accurately reflect the larger group.
Core Example Questions:
A dot plot shows the ages of a population of customers. Another dot plot shows the ages of a sample. Do the dot plots suggest the sample is representative? Explain.
Given a dot plot of a sample, describe what kind of population it might represent, or if it appears biased.

Name: Recognize how random sampling leads to representative samples and valid inferences
Description: This skill emphasizes the importance of random sampling. Students will explain why random sampling is crucial for producing representative samples and, consequently, for supporting valid statistical inferences about a population. They will understand that randomness helps minimize bias and ensures that conclusions drawn from the sample can be generalized to the larger group.
Core Example Questions:
Why is selecting names from a hat considered a better way to get a representative sample than just asking your friends?
If a sample is not random, how might that affect any conclusions you try to make about the population?

2. Make inferences from multiple samples
Name: Make inferences from multiple samples
Description: This skill enhances the understanding of sampling variability. Students will draw inferences about a population by analyzing and comparing multiple random samples of the same size, observing the variability in estimates. This helps them understand that different samples from the same population will yield slightly different results, but the overall trend provides a good estimate.
Core Example Questions:
Three different random samples of 20 students from a school showed that 12, 13, and 11 preferred reading, respectively. How would you use this information to make a better estimate for the whole school?
A factory takes 5 random samples of 100 items and finds 2, 3, 1, 2, and 4 defective items. What is your best estimate for the percentage of defective items in the entire production?

Description: This optional, deeper skill explores sampling variability by having students compare distributions of sample means using dot plots. By examining multiple samples, they can visually observe how much sample means vary around the true population mean, leading to a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty in statistical inference.
Core Example Questions:
Given dot plots of means from 10 different samples, describe the spread of these sample means.
If the true population mean is known, how do the sample means on the dot plot cluster around it?
Why might some sample means be far from the true population mean, and what does that tell you about a single sample?

14. Find the number of outcomes: word problems
Name: Find the number of outcomes: word problems
Description: This skill applies the fundamental counting principle (or systematic listing) to solve word problems that require finding the total number of outcomes for compound events. Students will interpret real-world scenarios and translate them into a structure for determining the total number of possibilities.
Core Example Questions:
A pizza shop offers 3 types of crust, 8 types of toppings, and 2 cheese options. How many different single-topping pizzas can be made?
You are choosing a password that must have 2 letters followed by 3 numbers. How many different passwords are possible if letters and numbers can be repeated?
How many different routes are there from City A to City C if there are 4 routes from A to B, and 3 routes from B to C?
Difficulty: Application
Common pitfalls:
Misinterpreting the problem, especially concerning repetition or specific constraints.
Setting up the multiplication incorrectly.
Failing to identify all the stages of the compound event.

15. Probability of compound events
Name: Probability of compound events
Description: This broad skill encompasses the calculation of probabilities for various compound events. It integrates the concepts of sample space, favorable outcomes, and the use of tools like tables or tree diagrams to determine the probability of multi-step scenarios. This often involves both identifying the total outcomes and the specific outcomes of interest.
Core Example Questions:
What is the probability of rolling a double (e.g., two 4s) when rolling two standard six-sided dice?
You have a bag with 3 red and 2 blue marbles. You pick one, don't replace it, then pick another. What is the probability of picking two red marbles?
A coin is flipped and a die is rolled. What is the probability of getting heads AND an even number?
Difficulty: Procedural/Analytical
Common pitfalls:
Incorrectly determining the total number of outcomes.
Not correctly identifying all favorable outcomes.
Errors in setting up or solving the probability fraction.

17. Identify independent and dependent events
Name: Identify independent and dependent events
Description: This crucial skill introduces the distinction between independent events (where the outcome of one event does not affect the probability of the other) and dependent events (where the outcome of the first event changes the probability of the second). Understanding this difference is fundamental for calculating compound probabilities correctly.
