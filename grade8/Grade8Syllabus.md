#### Assess the model fit by judging closeness of data points to the line
Description: Students will informally assess how well a straight line models the relationship in a scatter plot by judging how close the data points are to the line (i.e., the **strength of the association**).
* Core Example Questions:
    * Does the line of best fit strongly represent the relationship in this scatter plot, or is the data very scattered?
    * If most data points are far from the line of best fit, what does that tell you about the strength of the relationship?
    * Compare two scatter plots: which one shows a stronger linear relationship?

Difficulty: Conceptual
Difficulty rating: 6
Common pitfalls: Not distinguishing between the direction of the association and its strength, making definitive statements about correlation based on informal assessment.
Introduced definitions:
* **Model Fit**: How well a mathematical model (like a line of best fit) describes or represents the observed data.
* **Strength of Association**: How closely the data points cluster around the line of best fit. A tight cluster indicates a strong association.
