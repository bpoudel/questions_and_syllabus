Points C and D are located at ten o clock and eleven o clock respectively. Point Q is located at four o clock. A circle is centered at the point labeled Center with points Q, B, and A on it. Two rays point from the same endpoint, center. The first ray passes through point Q. The second ray passes through point A. The angle made by Q, the center, and A has an angle symbol. An arrow curves clockwise from point Q through point B to point A.",
