Therefore the point $\\left(\\pink1,\\blue{\\dfrac{10}{7}}\\,\\right)$ lies on the line.   However, to draw the graph, it will be useful to find another point on the line.  If $x$ increases from $0$ to $7$, then $y$ will increase from $0$ to $\\dfrac{10}{7}(\\pink7)=\\blue{10}$.  So the point $(\\pink7,\\blue{10})$ lies on the line.  We can graph the line connecting the points $(\\pink0,\\blue0)$ and $(\\pink7,\\blue{10})$.    [[☃ image 1]]",
