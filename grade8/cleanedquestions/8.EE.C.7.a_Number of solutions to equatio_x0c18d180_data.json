We should end with one of the following cases:  - An equation of the form $z=a$ (where $a$ is any number). In this case, the equation has exactly one solution.   - An equation of the form $a=a$ (where $a$ is a number). In this case, the equation has infinite solutions.    - An equation of the form $a=b$ (where $a$ and $b$ are different numbers). In this case, the equation has no solutions.  [[☃ explanation 1]]",
