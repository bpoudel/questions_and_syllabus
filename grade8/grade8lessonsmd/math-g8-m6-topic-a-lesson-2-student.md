Lesson 2: Interpreting Rate of Change and Initial Value

Classwork

Linear functions are defined by the equation of a line. The graphs and
the equations of the lines are important for understanding the
relationship between the two variables represented in the following
example as $x$ and $y$.

**Example 1: Rate of Change and Initial Value**

The equation of a line can be interpreted as defining a linear function.
The graphs and the equations of lines are important in understanding the
relationship between two types of quantities (represented in the
following examples by $x$ and $y$).

In a previous lesson, you encountered an MP3 download site that offers
downloads of individual songs with the following price structure: a
$\$ 3\ $fixed fee for a monthly subscription *plus* a fee of $\$ 0.25$
per song. The linear function that models the relationship between the
number of songs downloaded and the total monthly cost of downloading
songs can be written as

$y = 0.25x + 3$,

where $x$ represents the number of songs downloaded and $y$ represents
the total monthly cost (in dollars) for MP3 downloads.

In your own words, explain the meaning of $0.25$ within the context of
the problem.

In your own words, explain the meaning of $3$ within the context of the
problem.

The values represented in the function can be interpreted in the
following way:

$y = 0.25x + 3$

Exercises 1--6: Is It a Better Deal?

Another site offers MP3 downloads with a different price structure: a
$\$ 2$ fixed fee for a monthly subscription *plus* a fee of $\$ 0.40$
per song.

Write a linear function to model the relationship between the number of
songs downloaded and the total monthly cost. As before, let $x$
represent the number of songs downloaded and $y$ represent the total
monthly cost (in dollars) of downloading songs.

Determine the cost of downloading $0$ songs and $10$ songs from this
site.

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image1.wmf){width="4.21875in"
height="2.8125in"}The graph below already shows the linear model for the
first subscription site (Company 1): $y = 0.25x + 3$. Graph the equation
of the line for the second subscription site (Company 2) by marking the
two points from your work in Exercise 2 (for $0$ songs and $10$ songs)
and drawing a line through those two points.

Which line has a steeper slope? Which company's model has the more
expensive cost per song?

Which function has the greater initial value?

Which subscription site would you choose if you only wanted to download
$5$ songs per month? Which company would you choose if you wanted to
download $10$ songs? Explain your reasoning.

Exercises 7--9: Aging Autos

When someone purchases a new car and begins to drive it, the mileage
(meaning the number of miles the car has traveled) immediately
increases. Let $x$ represent the number of years since the car was
purchased and $y$ represent the total miles traveled. The linear
function that models the relationship between the number of years since
purchase and the total miles traveled is $y = 15000x$.

Identify and interpret the rate of change.

Identify and interpret the initial value.

Is the mileage increasing or decreasing each year according to the
model? Explain your reasoning.

When someone purchases a new car and begins to drive it, generally
speaking, the resale value of the car (in dollars) goes down each year.
Let $x$ represent the number of years since purchase and $y$ represent
the resale value of the car (in dollars). The linear function that
models the resale value based on the number of years since purchase is\
$y = 20000 - 1200x$.

Identify and interpret the rate of change.

Identify and interpret the initial value.

Is the resale value increasing or decreasing each year according to the
model? Explain.

Suppose you are given the linear function $y = 2.5x + 10$.

Write a story that can be modeled by the given linear function.

What is the rate of change? Explain its meaning with respect to your
story.

What is the initial value? Explain its meaning with respect to your
story.

Lesson Summary

When a linear function is given by the equation of a line of the form
$y = mx + b$, the rate of change is $m$, and the initial value is $b$.
Both are easy to identify.

The rate of change of a linear function is the slope of the line it
represents. It is the change in the values of $y$ per a one-unit
increase in the values of $x$*.*

- A positive rate of change indicates that a linear function is
  increasing.

- A negative rate of change indicates that a linear function is
  decreasing.

- Given two lines each with positive slope, the function represented by
  the steeper line has a greater rate of change.

The initial value of a linear function is the value of the $y$-variable
when the $x$-value is zero.

Problem Set

A rental car company offers the following two pricing methods for its
customers to choose from for a one-month rental:

Method 1: Pay $\$ 400$ for the month, or

Method 2: Pay $\$ 0.30$ per mile plus a standard maintenance fee of
$\$ 35$.

Construct a linear function that models the relationship between the
miles driven and the total rental cost for Method 2. Let $x$ represent
the number of miles driven and $y$ represent the rental cost (in
dollars).

If you plan to drive $1,100$ miles for the month, which method would you
choose? Explain your reasoning.

Recall from a previous lesson that Kelly wants to add new music to her
MP3 player. She was interested in a monthly subscription site that
offered its MP3 downloading service for a monthly subscription fee
*plus* a fee per song. The linear function that modeled the total
monthly cost in dollars ($y$) based on the number of songs downloaded
($x$) is\
$y = 5.25 + 0.30x$.

> The site has suddenly changed its monthly price structure. The linear
> function that models the new total monthly cost in dollars ($y$) based
> on the number of songs downloaded ($x$) is $y = 0.35x + 4.50$.

Explain the meaning of the value $4.50$ in the new equation. Is this a
better situation for Kelly than before?

Explain the meaning of the value $0.35$ in the new equation. Is this a
better situation for Kelly than before?

If you were to graph the two equations (old versus new), which line
would have the steeper slope? What does this mean in the context of the
problem?

Which subscription plan provides the better value if Kelly downloads
fewer than $15$ songs per month?
