Lesson Summary

Every decimal with a repeating pattern is a rational number, and we have
the means to determine the fraction that has a given repeating decimal
expansion.

Example: Find the fraction that is equal to the number
$0.\overline{567}$.

Let $x$ represent the infinite decimal $0.\overline{567}$.

This process may need to be used more than once when the repeating
digits, as in numbers such as $1.2\overline{6},$ do not begin
immediately after the decimal.

Irrational numbers are numbers that are not rational. They have infinite
decimal expansions that do not repeat and they cannot be expressed as
$\frac{p}{q}$ for integers $p$ and $q$ with $q \neq 0$.

Problem Set

1.  a.  Let $x = 0.\overline{631}$. Explain why multiplying both sides
        of this equation by $10^{3}$ will help us determine the

        fractional representation of $x$.

5.  Find the fraction equal to $3.40\overline{8}$. Check your answer
    using a calculator.

6.  Find the fraction equal to $0.\overline{5923}$. Check your answer

    using a calculator.

8.  Find the fraction equal to $0.\overline{714285}$. Check your answer
    using a calculator.

9.  Explain why an infinite decimal that is not a repeating decimal
    cannot be rational.

10. In a previous lesson, we were convinced that it is acceptable to
    write $0.\overline{9} = 1$. Use what you learned today to show that
    it is true.

11. Examine the following repeating infinite decimals and their fraction
    equivalents. What do you notice? Why do you think what you observed
    is true?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  $$0.\overline{81} = \frac{81}{99}$$         $$0.\overline{4} = \frac{4}{9}$$     $$0.\overline{123} = \frac{123}{999}$$           $$0.\overline{60} = \frac{60}{99}$$
  ------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------
  $$0.\overline{4311} = \frac{4311}{9999}$$   $$0.\overline{01} = \frac{1}{99}$$   $$0.\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{9}$$   $$0.\overline{9} = 1.0$$
