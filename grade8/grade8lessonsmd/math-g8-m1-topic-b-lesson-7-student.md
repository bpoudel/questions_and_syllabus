Lesson 7: Magnitude

Classwork

Fact 1: *The number* $10^{n}$*, for arbitrarily large positive integers*
$n$*, is a* big number in the sense that given a number $M$ (no matter
how big it is) there is a power of $10$ that exceeds $M$.

Fact 2: *The number* $10^{- n}$*, for arbitrarily large positive
integers* $n$*, is a* small number in the sense that given a positive
number $S\ $(no matter how small it is), there is a (negative) power of
$10$ that is smaller than $S$.

Exercise 1

Let $M = 993,456,789,098,765$. Find the smallest power of $10$ that will
exceed $M$.

Exercise 2

Let $M = 78,491$ $\frac{899}{987}$. Find the smallest power of $10$ that
will exceed $M$.

Exercise 3

Let $M$ be a positive integer. Explain how to find the smallest power of
$10$ that exceeds it.

Exercise 4

The chance of you having the same DNA as another person (other than an
identical twin) is approximately $1$ in $10$ trillion (one trillion is a
$1$ followed by $12$ zeros). Given the fraction, express this very small
number using a negative power of $10$.

$$\frac{1}{10\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000}$$

Exercise 5

The chance of winning a big lottery prize is about $10^{- 8}$, and the
chance of being struck by lightning in the U.S. in any given year is
about $0.000\, 001$. Which do you have a greater chance of experiencing?
Explain.

Exercise 6

There are about $100$ million smartphones in the U.S. Your teacher has
one smartphone. What share of U.S. smartphones does your teacher have?
Express your answer using a negative power of $10$.

Problem Set

What is the smallest power of $10$ that would exceed
$987,654,321,098,765,432$?

What is the smallest power of $10$ that would exceed $999,999,999,991$?

Which number is equivalent to $0.000\, 000\, 1$: $10^{7}$or $10^{- 7}$?
How do you know?

Sarah said that $0.000\, 01$ is bigger than $0.001$ because the first
number has more digits to the right of the decimal point. Is Sarah
correct? Explain your thinking using negative powers of $10$ and the
number line.

Order the following numbers from least to greatest:

$$10^{5}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 10^{- 99}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 10^{- 17}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 10^{14}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 10^{- 5}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 10^{30}$$
