Lesson Summary

Equations that contain variables that are squared or cubed can be solved
using the properties of equality and the definition of square and cube
roots.

Simplify an equation until it is in the form of $x^{2} = p$ or
$x^{3} = p$, where $p$ is a positive rational number; then, take the
square or cube root to determine the positive value of $x.$
