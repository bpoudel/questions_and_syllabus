$$m\angle 1 + m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 = m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 + m\angle 6 = m\angle 7 + m\angle 8 + m\angle 9 = 180{^\circ}$$

Note that the sum of the measures of angles $7$ and $9$ must equal
$90{^\circ}$ because of the known right angle in the right triangle.

Exploratory Challenge 1

Let triangle $ABC$ be given. On the ray from $B$ to $C$, take a point
$D$ so that $C$ is between $B$ and $D$. Through point $C$, draw a
segment parallel to $\overline{AB}$, as shown. Extend the segments $AB$
and $CE$*.* Line $AC$ is the transversal that intersects the parallel
lines.

Name the three interior angles of triangle $ABC$.

Name the straight angle.

What kinds of angles are $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ECD$? What does that
mean about their measures?

What kinds of angles are $\angle BAC$ and $\angle ECA$? What does that
mean about their measures?

We know that
$m\angle BCD = m\angle BCA + m\angle ECA + m\angle ECD = 180{^\circ}$.
Use substitution to show that the measures of the three interior angles
of the triangle have a sum of $180{^\circ}$.

height="2.8944444444444444in"}The figure below shows parallel lines
$L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$. Let $m$ and $n$ be transversals that intersect
$L_{1}$ at points $B$ and $C$, respectively, and $L_{2}$ at point $F$,
as shown. Let $A$ be a point on $L_{1}$ to the left of $B$, $D$ be a
point on $L_{1}$ to the right of $C$, $G$ be a point on $L_{2}$ to the
left of $F,$ and $E$ be a point on $L_{2}$ to the right of $F$.

Name the triangle in the figure.

Name a straight angle that will be useful in proving that the sum of the
measures of the interior angles of the triangle is $180{^\circ}$.

Write your proof below.

Lesson Summary

All triangles have a sum of measures of the interior angles equal to
$180{^\circ}$.

The proof that a triangle has a sum of measures of the interior angles
equal to $180{^\circ}$ is dependent upon the knowledge of straight
angles and angle relationships of parallel lines cut by a transversal.
