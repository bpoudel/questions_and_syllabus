Exercises 1--4

Gerald and Sarah are building a wheel with a radius of $6.5\ cm$ and are
trying to determine the circumference. Gerald says, "Because
$6.5 \times 2 \times 3.14 = 40.82$, the circumference is $40.82\ cm$."
Sarah says, "Because\
$6.5 \times 2 \times 3.10 = 40.3$ and
$6.5 \times 2 \times 3.21 = 41.73$, the circumference is somewhere
between $40.3$ and $41.73$." Explain the thinking of each student.

Lesson Summary

Numbers, such as $\pi$, are frequently approximated in order to compute
with them. Common approximations for $\pi$ are $3.14$ and
$\frac{22}{7}$. It should be understood that using an approximate value
of a number for computations produces an answer that is accurate to only
the first few decimal digits.

Problem Set

Caitlin estimated $\pi$ to be $3.10 < \pi < 3.21$. If she uses this
approximation of $\pi$ to determine the area of a circle with a radius
of $5\ cm$, what could the area be?

Myka estimated the circumference of a circle with a radius of $4.5\ in.$
to be $28.44\ in.$ What approximate value of $\pi$ did she use? Is it an
acceptable approximation of $\pi$? Explain.

A length of ribbon is being cut to decorate a cylindrical cookie jar.
The ribbon must be cut to a length that stretches the length of the
circumference of the jar. There is only enough ribbon to make one cut.
When approximating $\pi$ to calculate the circumference of the jar,
which number in the interval $3.10 < \pi < 3.21$ should be used?
Explain.
