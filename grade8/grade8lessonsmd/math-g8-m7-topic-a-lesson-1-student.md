Lesson Summary

Perfect square numbers are those that are a product of an integer factor
multiplied by itself. For example, the number $25$ is a perfect square
number because it is the product of $5$ multiplied by $5.$

When the square of the length of an unknown side of a right triangle is
not equal to a perfect square, you can estimate the length as a whole
number by determining which two perfect squares the square of the length
is between.

Example:

Let $c\ in.$ represent the length of the hypotenuse. Then,

$${3^{2} + 7^{2} = c^{2}
}{9 + 49 = c^{2}
}{58 = c^{2}\text{.}}$$

The number $58$ is not a perfect square, but it is between the perfect
squares $49$ and $64$. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is
between $7\ in.\ $and $8\ in.$ but closer to $8\ in.$ because $58$ is
closer to the perfect square $64$ than it is to the perfect square $49$.
