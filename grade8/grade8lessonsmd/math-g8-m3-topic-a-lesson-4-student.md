Lesson Summary

**[Theorem]{.smallcaps}**: Given a dilation with center $O$ and scale
factor $r$, then for any two points $P$ and $Q$ in the plane so that
$O$, $P$, and $Q$ are not collinear, the lines $PQ$ and $P'Q'$ are
parallel, where $P' = Dilation(P)$ and $Q' = Dilation(Q)$, and
furthermore, $|P'Q'| = r|PQ|$.

Problem Set

Use a piece of notebook paper to verify the fundamental theorem of
similarity for a scale factor $r$ that is $0 < r < 1$.

- Mark a point $O$ on the first line of notebook paper.

- Mark the point $P$ on a line several lines down from the center$\ O$.
  Draw a ray, $\overrightarrow{OP}$. Mark the point $P'$ on the ray and
  on a line of the notebook paper closer to $O$ than you placed point
  $P$. This ensures that you have a scale factor that is $0 < r < 1$.
  Write your scale factor at the top of the notebook paper.

- Draw another ray, $\overrightarrow{OQ}$, and mark the points $Q$ and
  $Q'$ according to your scale factor.

- Connect points $P$ and $Q$. Then, connect points $P'$ and $Q'$.

- Place a point, $A$, on the line containing segment $PQ$ between points
  $P$ and $Q$. Draw ray $\overrightarrow{OA}$. Mark point $A'$ at the
  intersection of the line containing segment $P'Q'$ and ray
  $\overrightarrow{OA}$.

  a.  Are the lines containing segments $PQ$ and $P'Q'$ parallel lines?
      How do you know?

  b.  Which, if any, of the following pairs of angles are equal in
      measure? Explain.

      i.  $\angle OPQ$ and $\angle OP'Q'$

      ii. $\angle OAQ$ and $\angle OA'Q'$

      iii. $\angle OAP$ and $\angle OA'P'$

      iv. $\angle OQP$ and $\angle OQ'P'$

  c.  Which, if any, of the following statements are true? Show your
      work to verify or dispute each statement.

      i.  $|OP'| = r|OP|$

      ii. $|OQ'| = r|OQ|$

      iii. $|P'A'| = r|PA|$

      iv. $|A'Q'| = r|AQ|$

  d.  Do you believe that the fundamental theorem of similarity (FTS) is
      true even when the scale factor is $0 < r < 1$? Explain.

      Caleb sketched the following diagram on graph paper. He dilated
      points $B$ and $C$ from center $O$.
