Lesson 9: Decimal Expansions of Fractions, Part 1

Classwork

Opening Exercise

a.  Compute the decimal expansions of $\frac{5}{6}$ and $\frac{7}{9}$.

b.  What is $\frac{5}{6}\mathbf{+}\frac{7}{9}\mathbf{\ }$as a fraction?
    What is the decimal expansion of this fraction?

c.  What is $\frac{5}{6}\mathbf{\times}\frac{7}{9}$ as a fraction?
    According to a calculator, what is the decimal expansion of the
    answer?

d.  If you were given just the decimal expansions of $\frac{5}{6}$ and
    $\frac{7}{9}$, without knowing which fractions produced them, do you
    think you could easily add the two decimals to find the decimal
    expansion of their sum? Could you easily multiply the two decimals
    to find the decimal expansion of their product?

Exercise 1

Two irrational numbers $x$ and $y$ have infinite decimal expansions that
begin $0.67035267\ldots$ for $x$ and\
$0.84991341$...$\ $for $y$.

a.  Explain why $0.670$ is an approximation for $x$ with an error of
    less than one thousandth. Explain why $0.849$ is an approximation
    for $y$ with an error of less than one thousandth.

e.  Using the approximations given in part (a), what is an
    approxi**m**ate value for $x + y$, for $x \times y$, and for\
    $x^{2} + 7y^{2}$?

f.  Repeat part (b), but use approximations for $x$ and $y$ that have
    errors less than $\frac{1}{10^{5}}$.

Exercise 2

Two real numbers have decimal expansions that begin with the following:

$x = 0.1538461$....

$y = 0.3076923$....

a.  Using approximations for $x$ and $y\ $that are accurate within a
    measure of $\frac{1}{10^{3}\ }$, find approximate values for
    $x + y$ and $y - 2x$.

<!-- -->

g.  Using approximations for $x$ and $y\ $that are accurate within a
    measure of $\frac{1}{10^{7}}$, find approximate values for $x + y$
    and $y - 2x$.

h.  We now reveal that $x = \frac{2}{13}$ and $y = \frac{4}{13}$. How
    accurate is your approximate value to $y - 2x$ from part (a)? From
    part (b)?

i.  Compute the first seven decimal places of $\frac{6}{13}$. How
    accurate is your approximate value to $x + y$ from part (a)? From
    part (b)?

Lesson Summary

It is not clear how to perform arithmetic on numbers given as infinitely
long decimals. If we approximate these numbers by truncating their
infinitely long decimal expansions to a finite number of decimal places,
then we can perform arithmetic on the approximate values to estimate
answers.

Truncating a decimal expansion to $n$ decimal places gives an
approximation with an error of less than $\frac{1}{10^{n}}$. For
example, $0.676$ is an approximation for $0.676767$... with an error of
less than $0.001$.

Problem Set

1.  Two irrational numbers $x$ and $y$ have infinite decimal expansions
    that begin $0.3338117\ldots$ for $x\ $and\
    $0.9769112$... for $y$.

    a.  Explain why $0.33$ is an approximation for $x$ with an error of
        less than one hundredth. Explain why $0.97$ is an approximation
        for $y$ with an error of less than one hundredth.

    b.  Using the approximations given in part (a), what is an
        approximate value for $2x(y + 1)$?

    c.  Repeat part (b), but use approximations for $x$ and $y$ that
        have errors less than $\frac{1}{10^{6}}$.

1.  Two real numbers have decimal expansions that begin with the
    following:

$x = 0.70588$....

$y = 0.23529$....

a.  Using approximations for $x$ and $y\ $that are accurate within a
    measure of $\frac{1}{10^{2}\ }$, find approximate values for
    $x + 1.25y$ and $\frac{x}{y}$.

b.  Using approximations for $x$ and $y\ $that are accurate within a
    measure of $\frac{1}{10^{4}}$, find approximate values for
    $x + 1.25y$ and $\frac{x}{y}$.

c.  We now reveal that $x$ and $y$ are rational numbers with the
    property that each of the values $x + 1.25y$ and $\frac{x}{y}$ is a
    whole number. Make a guess as to what whole numbers these values
    are, and use your guesses to find what fractions $x$ and $y$ might
    be.
