10. Genny babysits for two different families. One family pays her
    $\$ 6$ each hour and a bonus of $\$ 20$ at the end of the night. The
    other family pays her $\$ 3\ $every half hour and a bonus of $\$ 25$
    at the end of the night. Write and solve the system of equations
    that represents this situation. At what number of hours do the two
    families pay the same for babysitting services from Genny?

Lesson Summary

By definition, parallel lines do not intersect; therefore, a system of
linear equations whose graphs are parallel lines will have no solution.

Parallel lines have the same slope but no common point. One can verify
that two lines are parallel by comparing their slopes and their
$y$-intercept points.
