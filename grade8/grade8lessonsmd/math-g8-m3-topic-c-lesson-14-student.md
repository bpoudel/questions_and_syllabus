Problem Set

Lesson Summary

The converse of the Pythagorean theorem states that if the side lengths
of a triangle, $a$, $b$, $c$, satisfy $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$, then the
triangle is a right triangle.

If the side lengths of a triangle, $a$, $b$, $c$, do not satisfy
$a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$, then the triangle is not a right triangle.

We need to check if $27^{2} + 45^{2} = 36^{2}\ $is a true statement. The
left side of the equation is equal to $2,754$. The right side of the
equation is equal to $1,296$. That means$\ 27^{2} + 45^{2} = 36^{2}\ $is
not true, and the triangle shown is not a right triangle.
