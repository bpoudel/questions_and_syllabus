Problem Set

You forward an e-card that you found online to three of your friends.
They liked it so much that they forwarded it on to four of their
friends, who then forwarded it on to four of their friends, and so on.
The number of people who saw the e-card is shown below. Let $S_{1}$
represent the number of people who saw the e-card after one step, let
$S_{2}$ represent the number of people who saw the e-card after two
steps, and so on.

$${S_{1} = 3
}{S_{2} = 3 + 3 \cdot 4
}{S_{3} = 3 + 3 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 4^{2}
}{S_{4} = 3 + 3 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 4^{2} + 3 \cdot 4^{3}
}$$

Find the pattern in the equations.

Assuming the trend continues, how many people will have seen the e-card
after $10$ steps?

How many people will have seen the e-card after $n$ steps?

For each of the following questions, write an equation, and solve to
find each answer.
