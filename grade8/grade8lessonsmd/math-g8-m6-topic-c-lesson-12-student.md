**Example 1: Growing Dahlias**

A group of students wanted to determine whether or not compost is
beneficial in plant growth. The students used the dahlia flower to study
the effect of composting. They planted eight dahlias in a bed with no
compost and another eight plants in a bed with compost. They measured
the height of each plant over a $9$-week period. They found the median
growth height for each group of eight plants. The table below shows the
results of the experiment for the dahlias grown in non-compost beds.

the previous week's height from the current height. Record the weekly

As the number of weeks increases, describe how the growth changes.

Sketch a curve through the data. When sketching a curve, do not connect
the ordered pairs, but draw a smooth curve that you think reasonably
describes the data.

Use the curve to estimate the median height of the dahlias
at$\ 8\frac{1}{2}\ $weeks. Explain how you made your estimate.

How does the weekly growth of the dahlias in the compost beds compare to
the weekly growth of the dahlias in the non-compost beds?

When there is a car accident, how do the investigators determine the
speed of the cars involved? One way is to measure the skid marks left by
the cars and use these lengths to estimate the speed.

> The table below shows data collected from an experiment with a test
> car. The first column is the length of the skid mark (in feet), and
> the second column is the speed of the car (in miles per hour).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Skid-Mark Length (feet)**         **Speed (miles per hour)**

Construct a scatter plot of speed versus skid-mark length on the grid

The relationship between speed and skid-mark length can be described by
a curve. Sketch a curve through the data that best represents the
relationship between skid-mark length and speed of the car. Remember to
draw a smooth curve that does not just connect the ordered pairs.

If the car left a skid mark of $60\ ft.$, what is an estimate for the
speed of the car? Explain how you determined the estimate.

A car left a skid mark of $150\ ft$. Use the curve you sketched to
estimate the speed at which the car was traveling.

If a car leaves a skid mark that is twice as long as another skid mark,
was the car going twice as fast? Explain.

Lesson Summary

When data follow a linear pattern, they can be represented by a linear
function whose rate of change can be used to answer questions about the
data. When data do not follow a linear pattern, then there is no
constant rate of change.

Problem Set

Once the brakes of the car have been applied, the car does not stop
immediately. The distance that the car travels after the brakes have
been applied is called the *braking distance*. The table below shows
braking distance (how far the car travels once the brakes have been
applied) and the speed of the car.
