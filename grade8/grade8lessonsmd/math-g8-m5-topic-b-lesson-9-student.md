    Write and describe a function that will allow you to determine the
    volume of any rectangular prism that has a base area of
    $36\ {cm}^{2}$.

Lesson Summary

There are a few basic assumptions that are made when working with
volume:

(a) The volume of a solid is always a number greater than or equal to
    $0$.

(b) The volume of a unit cube (i.e., a rectangular prism whose edges all
    have a length of $1$) is by definition $1$ cubic unit.

(c) If two solids are identical, then their volumes are equal.

(d) If two solids have (at most) their boundaries in common, then their
    total volume can be calculated by adding the individual volumes
    together. (These figures are sometimes referred to as composite
    solids.)
