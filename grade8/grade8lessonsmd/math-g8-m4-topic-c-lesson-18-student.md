Problem Set

Lesson Summary

The equation $y = mx + b$ is in slope-intercept form. The number $m$
represents the slope of the graph, and the point $(0,\ b)$ is the
location where the graph of the line intersects the $y$-axis.

To graph a line from the slope-intercept form of a linear equation,
begin with the known point, $(0,\ b)$, and then use the slope to find a
second point. Connect the points to graph the equation.

There is only one line passing through a given point with a given slope.

Graph each equation on a separate pair of $x$- and $y$-axes.

1.  Graph the equation $y = \frac{4}{5}x - 5$.

    a.  Name the slope and the $y$-intercept point.

    b.  Graph the known point, and then use the slope to find a second
        point before drawing the line.
