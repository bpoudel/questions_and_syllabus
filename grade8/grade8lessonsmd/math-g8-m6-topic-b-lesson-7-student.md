Lesson 7: Patterns in Scatter Plots

Classwork

**Example 1**

In the previous lesson, you learned that scatter plots show trends in
bivariate data.

When you look at a scatter plot, you should ask yourself the following
questions:

a.  Does it look like there is a relationship between the two variables
    used to make the scatter plot?

b.  If there is a relationship, does it appear to be linear?

c.  If the relationship appears to be linear, is the relationship a
    positive linear relationship or a negative linear relationship?

To answer the first question, look for patterns in the scatter plot.
Does there appear to be a general pattern to the points in the scatter
plot, or do the points look as if they are scattered at random? If you
see a pattern, you can answer the second question by thinking about
whether the pattern would be well described by a line. Answering the
third question requires you to distinguish between a positive linear
relationship and a negative linear relationship. A positive linear
relationship is one that is described by a line with a positive slope. A
negative linear relationship is one that is described by a line with a
negative slope.

Exercises 1--9

Take a look at the following five scatter plots. Answer the three
questions in Example 1 for each scatter plot.

kilograms and newtons, respectively.)

**Example 2: Clusters and Outliers**

In addition to looking for a general pattern in a scatter plot, you
should also look for other interesting features that might help you
understand the relationship between two variables. Two things to watch
for are as follows:

- **[Clusters]{.smallcaps}:** Usually, the points in a scatter plot form
  a single cloud of points, but sometimes the points may form two or
  more distinct clouds of points. These clouds are called *clusters*.
  Investigating these clusters may tell you something useful about the
  data.

- **[Outliers]{.smallcaps}:** An *outlier* is an unusual point in a
  scatter plot that does not seem to fit the general pattern or that is
  far away from the other points in the scatter plot.

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image10.png){width="4.469444444444444in"
height="2.98125in"}The scatter plot below was constructed using data
from a study of Rocky Mountain elk ("Estimating Elk Weight from Chest
Girth," *Wildlife Society Bulletin*, 1996). The variables studied were
chest girth in centimeters ($x$) and weight in kilograms ($y$).

Exercises 10--12

8.  Do you notice any point in the scatter plot of elk weight versus
    chest girth that might be described as an outlier? If so, which one?

9.  If you identified an outlier in Exercise 10, write a sentence
    describing how this data observation differs from the others in the
    data set.

10. Do you notice any clusters in the scatter plot? If so, how would you
    distinguish between the clusters in terms of chest girth? Can you
    think of a reason these clusters might have occurred?

Problem Set

Lesson Summary

- A scatter plot might show a linear relationship, a nonlinear
  relationship, or no relationship.

- A positive linear relationship is one that would be modeled using a
  line with a positive slope. A negative linear relationship is one that
  would be modeled by a line with a negative slope.

- Outliers in a scatter plot are unusual points that do not seem to fit
  the general pattern in the plot or that are far away from the other
  points in the scatter plot.

- Clusters occur when the points in the scatter plot appear to form two
  or more distinct clouds of points.

1.  Suppose data was collected on size in square feet ($x$) of several
    houses and price in dollars ($y$). The data was then used to
    construct the scatterplot below. Write a few sentences describing
    the relationship between price and size for these houses. Are there
    any noticeable clusters or outliers?

    part in a large-scale assessment called the National Assessment of
