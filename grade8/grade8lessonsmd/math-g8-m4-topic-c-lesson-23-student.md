Lesson Summary

Two equations define the same line if the graphs of those two equations
are the same given line. Two equations that define the same line are the
same equation, just in different forms. The equations may look different
(different constants, different coefficients, or different forms).

When two equations are written in standard form, $ax + by = c$ and
$a'x + b'y = c'$, they define the same line when
$\frac{a'}{a} = \frac{b'}{b} = \frac{c'}{c}$ is true.

Problem Set

11. Challenge: Show that if the two lines given by $ax + by = c$ and
    $a'x + b'y = c'$ are the same when $b = 0$ (vertical lines), then

    and $c' = sc$.

12. Challenge: Show that if the two lines given by $ax + by = c$ and
    $a'x + b'y = c'$ are the same when $a = 0$ (horizontal lines), then
    there exists a nonzero number $s$ so that $a' = sa$*,* $b' = sb$,
    and $c' = sc.$
