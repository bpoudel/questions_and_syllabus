Lesson Summary

The volume formula for a right square pyramid is $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$,
where $B$ is the area of the square base.

The lateral length of a cone, sometimes referred to as the slant height,
is the side $s$, shown in the diagram below.

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image14.png){width="1.3344510061242345in"
height="1.3547462817147857in"}

Given the lateral length and the length of the radius, the Pythagorean
theorem can be used to determine the height of the cone.

Let $O$ be the center of a circle, and let $P$ and $Q$ be two points on
the circle. Then $\overline{PQ}$ is called a chord of the circle.

height="1.348772965879265in"}

The segments $OP$ and $OQ$ are equal in length because both represent
the radius of the circle. If the angle formed by $POQ$ is a right angle,
then the Pythagorean theorem can be used to determine the length of the
radius when given the length of the chord, or the length of the chord
can be determined if given the length of the radius.

13. Alejandra computed the volume of the cone shown below as
    $64\pi\ {cm}^{3}$. Her work is shown below. Is she correct?\
    If not, explain what she did wrong, and calculate the correct volume
    of the cone. Give an exact answer.

$$V = \frac{1}{3}\pi(4)^{2}(12)$$

$${= \frac{(16)(12)\pi}{3}
}{= 64\pi
}$$

> The volume of the cone is $64\pi\ cm^{3}.$
