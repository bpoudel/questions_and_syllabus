Lesson 13: Summarizing Bivariate Categorical Data in a Two-Way Table

Classwork

Exercises 1--8

On an upcoming field day at school, the principal wants to provide ice
cream during lunch. She offers three flavors: chocolate, strawberry, and
vanilla. She selected your class to complete a survey to help her
determine how much of each flavor to buy.

Answer the following question. Wait for your teacher to count how many
students selected each flavor.\
Then, record the class totals for each flavor in the table below.

> "Which of the following three ice cream flavors is your favorite:
> chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla?"

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Ice Cream Flavor**  **Chocolate**   **Strawberry**   **Vanilla**   **Total**
  -------------------- --------------- ---------------- ------------- ------------
      **Number of                                                     
       Students**                                                     

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which ice cream flavor do most students prefer?

Which ice cream flavor do the fewest students prefer?

What percentage of students preferred each flavor? Round to the nearest
tenth of a percent.

Do the numbers in the table in Exercise 1 summarize data on a
categorical variable or a numerical variable?

Do the students in your class represent a random sample of all the
students in your school? Why or why not? Discuss this with your
neighbor.

Is your class representative of all the other classes at your school?
Why or why not? Discuss this with your neighbor.

Do you think the principal will get an accurate estimate of the
proportion of students who prefer each ice cream flavor for the whole
school using only your class? Why or why not? Discuss this with your
neighbor.

**Example 1**

Students in a different class were asked the same question about their
favorite ice cream flavors. The table below shows the ice cream flavors
and the number of students who chose each flavor for that particular
class. This table is called a *one-way frequency table* because it shows
the counts of a univariate categorical variable.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Ice Cream     **Chocolate**   **Strawberry**   **Vanilla**     **Total**
  Flavor**                                                       
  -------------- --------------- ---------------- -------------- --------------
  **Number of        $$11$$           $$4$$           $$10$$         $$25$$
  Students**                                                     

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the univariate categorical variable.

These are the counts for each category.

We compute the relative frequency for each ice cream flavor by dividing
the count by the total number of observations.

$$relative\ frequency = \ \frac{count\ for\ a\ category}{\ total\ number\ of\ observations}$$

Since $11$ out of $25$ students answered *chocolate*, the relative
frequency would be $\frac{11}{25} \approx 0.44$. This relative frequency
shows that $44\%$ of the class prefers chocolate ice cream. In other
words, the relative frequency is the proportional value that each
category is of the whole.

Exercises 9--10

Use the table for the preferred ice cream flavors from the class in
Example 1 to answer the following questions.

What is the relative frequency for the category *strawberry*?

Write a sentence interpreting the relative frequency value in the
context of strawberry ice cream preference.

**Example 2**

The principal also wondered if boys and girls have different favorite
ice cream flavors. She decided to redo the survey by taking a random
sample of students from the school and recording both their favorite ice
cream flavors and their genders. She asked the following two questions:

- "Which of the following ice cream flavors is your favorite: chocolate,
  strawberry, or vanilla?"

- "What is your gender: male or female?"

The results of the survey are as follows:

- Of the $30$ students who prefer chocolate ice cream, $22$ are males.

- Of the $25$ students who prefer strawberry ice cream, $15$ are
  females.

- Of the $27$ students who prefer vanilla ice cream, $13$ are males.

The values of two variables, which were ice cream flavor and gender,
were recorded in this survey. Since both of the variables are
categorical, the data are bivariate categorical data.

Exercises 11--17

Can we display these data in a one-way frequency table? Why or why not?

Summarize the results of the second survey of favorite ice cream flavors
in the following table:

+------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------+------------+
|            |            | **Favorite Ice Cream Flavor**                    |            |

+------------+------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+------------+

Calculate the relative frequencies of the data in the table in Exercise
12, and write them in the following table.

+------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------+------------+
|            |            | **Favorite Ice Cream Flavor**                    |            |

+------------+------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+------------+

Use the relative frequency values in the table to answer the following
questions:

What is the proportion of the students who prefer chocolate ice cream?

What is the proportion of students who are female and prefer vanilla ice
cream?

Write a sentence explaining the meaning of the approximate relative
frequency$\ 0.55$.

Write a sentence explaining the meaning of the approximate relative
frequency $0.10$.

**Example 3**

In the previous exercises, you used the total number of students to
calculate relative frequencies. These relative frequencies were the
proportion of the whole group who answered the survey a certain way.
Sometimes we use row or column totals to calculate relative frequencies.
We call these *row relative frequencies* or *column relative
frequencies*.

Below is the two-way frequency table for your reference. To calculate
"the proportion of male students who prefer chocolate ice cream," divide
the $22$ male students who preferred chocolate ice cream by the total of
$45$ male students. This proportion is $\frac{22}{45} = 0.49$. Notice
that you used the row total to make this calculation. This is a row
relative frequency.

+------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------+------------+
|            |            | **Favorite Ice Cream Flavor**                    |            |
+:==========:+:==========:+:==============:+:==============:+:==============:+:==========:+
|            |            | **Chocolate**  | **Strawberry** | **Vanilla**    | **Total**  |

+------------+------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+------------+

Exercises 18--22

In Exercise 13, you used the total number of students to calculate
relative frequencies. These relative frequencies were the proportion of
the whole group who answered the survey a certain way.

Suppose you are interested in the proportion of male students who prefer
chocolate ice cream. How is this value different from "the proportion of
students who are male and prefer chocolate ice cream"? Discuss this with
your neighbor.

Use the table provided in Example 3 to calculate the following relative
frequencies.

What proportion of students who prefer vanilla ice cream are female?

What proportion of male students prefer strawberry ice cream? Write a
sentence explaining the meaning of this proportion in context of this
problem.

What proportion of female students prefer strawberry ice cream?

Pregnant women often undergo ultrasound tests to monitor their babies'
health. These tests can also be used to predict the gender of the
babies, but these predictions are not always accurate. Data on the
gender predicted by ultrasound and the actual gender of the baby for
$1,000$ babies are summarized in the two-way table below.

+----------+---------------+---------------------------------------------+
