Lesson Summary

The graph of a function is defined to be the set of all points $(x,y)$
with $x$ an input for the function and $y$ its matching output.

If a function can be described by an equation, then the graph of the
function is the same as the graph of the equation that represents it (at
least at points which correspond to valid inputs of the function).

It is not possible for two different points in the plot of the graph of
a function to have the same $x$-coordinate.
