Classwork

Exercises

Identify two Pythagorean triples using the known triple $3$,$\ 4$,
$5\ $(other than $6$,$\ 8$,$\ 10).$

Identify two Pythagorean triples using the known triple
$5$,$\ 12$,$\ 13.$

Identify two triples using either $3$,$\ 4$, $5$ or $5$,$\ 12$,$\ 13.$

Use the system$\ \left\{ \begin{array}{r}
x + y = \frac{t}{s} \\
x - y = \frac{s}{t}
\end{array} \right.\ $ to find Pythagorean triples for the given values
of $s$ and $t.$ Recall that the solution in the form of
$\left( \frac{c}{b},\frac{a}{b} \right)$ is the triple $a$,$\ b$,$\ c$.

$s = 4$, $t = 5$

$s = 7$, $t = 10$

$s = 1$, $t = 4$

Use a calculator to verify that you found a Pythagorean triple in each
of the Exercises 4--6. Show your work below.

Lesson Summary

A Pythagorean triple is a set of three positive integers that satisfies
the equation $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}.$

An infinite number of Pythagorean triples can be found by multiplying
the numbers of a known triple by a whole number. For example, $3$, $4$,
$5$ is a Pythagorean triple. Multiply each number by $7$, and then you
have $21$,$\ 28$,$\ 35$, which is also a Pythagorean triple.

The system of linear equations, $\left\{ \begin{array}{r}
x + y = \frac{t}{s} \\
x - y = \frac{s}{t}
\end{array} \right.\ ,$ can be used to find Pythagorean triples, just
like the Babylonians did $4,000$ years ago.

Problem Set

Explain in terms of similar triangles why it is that when you multiply
the known Pythagorean triple $3$,$\ 4$, $5$ by $12$, it generates a
Pythagorean triple.

Identify three Pythagorean triples using the known triple
$8$,$\ 15$,$\ 17.$

Identify three triples (numbers that satisfy $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$,
but $a$,$\ b$,$\ c$ are not whole numbers) using the triple
$8$,$\ 15$,$\ 17$.

Use the system$\ \left\{ \begin{array}{r}
x + y = \frac{t}{s} \\
x - y = \frac{s}{t}
\end{array} \right.\ $ to find Pythagorean triples for the given values
of $s$ and $t$. Recall that the solution, in the form of
$\left( \frac{c}{b},\frac{a}{b} \right)$, is the triple $a$,$\ b$,$\ c.$

$s = 2$, $t = 9$

$s = 6$, $t = 7$

$s = 3$, $t = 4$
