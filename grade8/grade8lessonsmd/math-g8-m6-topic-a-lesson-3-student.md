rental fee in addition to a charge of $\$ 0.50$ per mile driven. Graph
the linear function relating the total cost of the rental in dollars,
$C$, to the number of miles driven, $m$, on the axes below.

Miles

Cost ($\$$)

a.  If the truck is driven $0$ miles, what is the cost to the customer?
    How is this shown on the graph?

b.  What is the rate of change that relates cost to number of miles
    driven? Explain what it means within the context of the problem.

c.  On the axes given, sketch the graph of the linear function that
    relates $C$ to $m$.

d.  Write the equation of the linear function that models the
    relationship between number of miles driven and total rental cost.

She has been told that the value of the car is likely to decrease by
$\$ 2,500$ for each year that she owns the car. Let the value of the car
in dollars be $V$ and the number of years Jenna has owned the car be
$t$.

Value of the Car in Dollars

Number of Years

1.  What is the value of the car when $t = 0$? Show this point on the
    graph.

1.  What is the rate of change that relates $V$ to $t$? (Hint: Is it
    positive or negative? How can you tell?)

2.  Find the value of the car when:

    a.  $t = 1$

    b.  $t = 2$

    c.  $t = 7$

3.  Plot the points for the values you found in Exercise 3, and draw the
    line (using a straightedge) that passes through those points.

4.  Write the linear function that models the relationship between the
    number of years Jenna has owned the car and the value of the car.

An online bookseller has a new book in print. The company estimates that
if the book is priced at $\$ 15$, then $800$ copies of the book will be
sold per day, and if the book is priced at $\$ 20$, then $550\ $copies
of the book will be sold per day.

5.  Identify the ordered pairs given in the problem. Then, plot both on
    the graph.

6.  Assume that the relationship between the number of books sold and
    the price is linear. (In other words, assume that the graph is a
    straight line.) Using a straightedge, draw the line that passes
    through the two points.

7.  What is the rate of change relating number of copies sold to price?

8.  Based on the graph, if the company prices the book at $\$ 18$, about
    how many copies of the book can they expect to sell per day?

9.  Based on the graph, approximately what price should the company
    charge in order to sell $700\ $copies of the book per day?

Lesson Summary

When the rate of change, $b$, and an initial value, $a$, are given in
the context of a problem, the linear function that models the situation
is given by the equation $y = a + bx$.

The rate of change and initial value can also be used to sketch the
graph of the linear function that models the situation.

When two or more ordered pairs are given in the context of a problem
that involves a linear relationship, the graph of the linear function is
the line that passes through those points. The linear function can be
represented by the equation of that line.

Problem Set

1.  A plumbing company charges a service fee of $\$ 120$, plus $\$ 40$
    for each hour worked. Sketch the graph of the linear function
    relating the cost to the customer (in dollars), $C$, to the time
    worked by the plumber (in hours), $t$, on the axes below.

Time in Hours

Cost in Dollars

a.  If the plumber works for $0$ hours, what is the cost to the
    customer? How is this shown on the graph?

b.  What is the rate of change that relates cost to time?

c.  Write a linear function that models the relationship between the
    hours worked and the cost to the customer.

d.  Find the cost to the customer if the plumber works for each of the
    following number of hours.

    i.  $1$ hour

    ii. $2$ hours

    iii. $6$ hours

e.  Plot the points for these times on the coordinate plane, and use a
    straightedge to draw the line through the points.

        relates the total amount of money earned in dollars, $A$, to the
        number of books sold, $n$, on the axes below.

Number of books sold

Total Amount of Money Earned in Dollars

Number of Books Sold

b.  What is the rate of change that relates the total amount of money
    earned to the number of books sold?

c.  What is the initial value of the linear function based on the graph?

    $A$. Construct a linear function that models the relationship
    between the number of books sold and the total amount earned.

    been falling. At the beginning of last month ($t = 0$), the price
    was $\$ 4.60$ per gallon. Twenty days later ($t = 20$), the price
    was $\$ 4.20$ per gallon. Assume that the price per gallon, $P$,
    fell at a constant rate over the twenty days.
