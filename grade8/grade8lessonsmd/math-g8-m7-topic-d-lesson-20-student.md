Lesson Summary

A truncated cone or pyramid is the solid obtained by removing the top
portion of a cone or a pyramid above a plane parallel to its base. Shown
below on the left is a truncated cone. A truncated cone with the top
portion still attached is shown below on the right.

To determine the volume of a truncated cone, you must first determine
the height of the portion of the cone that has been removed using ratios
that represent the corresponding sides of the right triangles. Next,
determine the volume of the portion of the cone that has been removed
and the volume of the truncated cone with the top portion attached.
Finally, subtract the volume of the cone that represents the portion
that has been removed from the complete cone. The difference represents
the volume of the truncated cone.
