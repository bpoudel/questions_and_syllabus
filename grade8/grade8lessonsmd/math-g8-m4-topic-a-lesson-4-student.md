Classwork

Exercises

For each problem, show your work, and check that your solution is
correct.

Solve the linear equation $x + x + 2 + x + 4 + x + 6 = - 28$. State the
property that justifies your first step and why you chose it.

Solve the linear equation $2(3x + 2) = 2x - 1 + x$. State the property
that justifies your first step and why you chose it.

Solve the linear equation $x - 9 = \frac{3}{5}x.$ State the property
that justifies your first step and why you chose it.

Solve the linear equation $29 - 3x = 5x + 5$. State the property that
justifies your first step and why you chose it.

Solve the linear equation $\frac{1}{3}x - 5 + 171 = x.$ State the
property that justifies your first step and why you chose it.

Lesson Summary

The properties of equality, shown below, are used to transform equations
into simpler forms. If $A,\ B,\ C$ are rational numbers, then:

- If $A = B,$ then $A + C = B + C$. Addition property of equality

- If $A = B,$ then $A - C = B - C$. Subtraction property of equality

- If $A = B,$ then $A \cdot C = B \cdot C$. Multiplication property of
  equality

- If $A = B,$ then $\frac{A}{C} = \frac{B}{C}$, where $C$ is not equal
  to zero. Division property of equality

To solve an equation, transform the equation until you get to the form
of $x$ equal to a constant ($x = 5$, for example).

Alysha solved the linear equation $2x - 3 - 8x = 14 + 2x - 1.$ Her work
is shown below. When she checked her answer, the left side of the
equation did not equal the right side. Find and explain Alysha's error,
and then solve the equation correctly.

$${2x - 3 - 8x = 14 + 2x - 1
}{- 6x - 3 = 13 + 2x
}{- 6x - 3 + 3 = 13 + 3 + 2x
}{- 6x = 16 + 2x
}{- 6x + 2x = 16
}{- 4x = 16
}{\frac{- 4}{- 4}x = \frac{16}{- 4}
}{x = - 4}$$
