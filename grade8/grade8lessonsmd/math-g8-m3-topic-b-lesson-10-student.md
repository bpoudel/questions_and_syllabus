Lesson 10: Informal Proof of AA Criterion for Similarity

Classwork

Exercises 1--5

1.  Use a protractor to draw a pair of triangles with two pairs of equal
    angles. Then, measure the lengths of the sides, and verify that the
    lengths of their corresponding sides are equal in ratio.

2.  Draw a new pair of triangles with two pairs of equal angles. Then,
    measure the lengths of the sides, and verify that the lengths of
    their corresponding sides are equal in ratio.

3.  Are the triangles shown below similar? Present an informal argument
    as to why they are or are not similar.
