Lesson Summary

Write the equation of a line by determining the $y$-intercept point,
$(0,\ b)$, and the slope, $m$, and replacing the numbers $b$ and $m$
into the equation $y = mx + b.$

Example:

The $y$-intercept point of this graph is $(0,\  - 2).$

The slope of this graph is $m = \frac{4}{1} = 4.$

The equation that represents the graph of this line is $y = 4x - 2.$

Use the properties of equality to change the equation from
slope-intercept form$,\ y = mx + b$, to standard form, $ax + by = c$,
where $a$,$\ b$, and$\ c$ are integers, and $a$ is not negative.
