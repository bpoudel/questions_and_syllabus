Exercises

1.  Peter paints a wall at a constant rate of $2$ square feet per
    minute. Assume he paints an area $y$, in square feet, after $x$
    minutes.

    a.  Express this situation as a linear equation in two variables.

    b.  Sketch the graph of the linear equation.

Lesson Summary

Problems involving constant rate can be expressed as linear equations in
two variables.

When given information about two proportional relationships, their rates
of change can be compared by comparing the slopes of the graphs of the
two proportional relationships.
