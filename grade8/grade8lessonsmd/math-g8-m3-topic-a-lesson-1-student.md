Lesson 1: What Lies Behind "Same Shape"?

Classwork

Exploratory Challenge

Two geometric figures are said to be similar if they have the same shape
but not necessarily the same size. Using that informal definition, are
the following pairs of figures similar to one another? Explain.

Lesson Summary

**Definition:** For a positive number $r$, a *dilation* *with center*
$O$ *and scale factor* $r$ is the transformation of the plane that maps
$O$ to itself, and maps each remaining point $P$ of the plane to its
image $P'$on the ray $\overrightarrow{OP}$ so that
$\left| OP' \right| = r|OP|$. That is, it is the transformation that
assigns to each point $P$ of the plane a point $Dilation(P)$ so that

7.  $Dilation(O) = O$ (i.e., a dilation does not move the center of
    dilation).

8.  If $P \neq O$, then the point $Dilation(P)$ (to be denoted more
    simply by $P'$) is the point on the ray $\overrightarrow{OP}$ so
    that $\left| {OP}' \right| = r|OP|$.

In other words, a dilation is a rule that moves each point $P$ along the
ray emanating from the center $O$ to a new point $P'$ on that ray such
that the distance $\left| OP' \right|$ is $r$ times the distance $|OP|.$
