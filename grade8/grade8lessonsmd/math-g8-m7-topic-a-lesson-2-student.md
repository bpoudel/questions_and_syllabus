Exercises 5--9

Determine the positive square root of the number given. If the number is
not a perfect square, determine which whole number the square root would
be closest to, and then use *guess and check* to give an approximate
answer to one or two decimal places.

$\sqrt{49}$

$\sqrt{62}$

$\sqrt{122}$

$\sqrt{400}$

Which of the numbers in Exercises 5--8$\ $are not perfect squares?
Explain.

Lesson Summary

A positive number whose square is equal to a positive number $b$ is
denoted by the symbol $\sqrt{b}$. The symbol $\sqrt{b}$ automatically
denotes a positive number. For example, $\sqrt{4}$ is always $2$, not
$- 2.$ The number $\sqrt{b}$ is called a *positive square root of* $b$.

The square root of a perfect square of a whole number is that whole
number. However, there are many whole numbers that are not perfect
squares.

Problem Set

Determine the positive square root of the number given. If the number is
