Lesson 1: Modeling Linear Relationships

Classwork

**Example 1: Logging On**

Lenore has just purchased a tablet computer, and she is considering
purchasing an Internet access plan so that she can connect to the
Internet wirelessly from virtually anywhere in the world. One company
offers an Internet access plan so that when a person connects to the
company's wireless network, the person is charged a fixed access fee for
connecting *plus* an amount for the number of minutes connected based
upon a constant usage rate in dollars per minute.

Lenore is considering this company's plan, but the company's
advertisement does not state how much the fixed access fee for
connecting is, nor does it state the usage rate. However, the company's
website says that a $10$-minute session costs $\$ 0.40$, a $20$-minute
session costs $\$ 0.70$, and a $30$-minute session costs $\$ 1.00$.
Lenore decides to use these pieces of information to determine both the
fixed access fee for connecting and the usage rate.

Exercises 1--6

1.  Lenore makes a table of this information and a graph where number of
    minutes is represented by the horizontal axis and total session cost
    is represented by the vertical axis. Plot the three given points on
    the graph. These three points appear to lie on a line. What
    information about the access plan suggests that the correct model is
    indeed a linear relationship?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         **Number of Minutes**        **Total Session Cost (in dollars)**
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
                 $$0$$                

                $$10$$                             $$0.40$$

                $$20$$                             $$0.70$$

                $$30$$                             $$1.00$$

                $$40$$                

                $$50$$                

                $$60$$                
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  The rate of change describes how the total cost changes with respect
    to time.

    a.  When the number of minutes increases by $10$ (e.g., from $10$
        minutes to $20$ minutes or from $20$ minutes to $30$ minutes),
        how much does the charge increase?

    b.  Another way to say this would be the usage charge per $10$
        minutes of use. Use that information to determine the increase
        in cost based on only $1$ minute of additional usage. In other
        words, find the usage charge per minute of use.

3.  The company's pricing plan states that the usage rate is constant
    for any number of minutes connected to the Internet. In other words,
    the increase in cost for $10$ more minutes of use (the value that
    you calculated in Exercise 2) is the same whether you increase from
    $20$ to $30$ minutes, $30$ to $40$ minutes, etc. Using this
    information, determine the total cost for $40\ $minutes, $50$
    minutes, and $60$ minutes of use. Record those values in the table,
    and plot the corresponding points on the graph in Exercise 1.

4.  Using the table and the graph in Exercise 1, compute the
    hypothetical cost for $0$ minutes of use. What does that value
    represent in the context of the values that Lenore is trying to
    figure out?

5.  On the graph in Exercise 1, draw a line through the points
    representing$\ 0$ to $60$ minutes of use under this company's plan.
    The slope of this line is equal to the rate of change, which in this
    case is the usage rate.

6.  Using $x\ $for the number of minutes and $y$ for the total cost in
    dollars, write a function to model the linear relationship between
    minutes of use and total cost.

**Example 2: Another Rate Plan**

A second wireless access company has a similar method for computing its
costs. Unlike the first company that Lenore was considering, this second
company explicitly states its access fee is $\$ 0.15$, and its usage
rate is $\$ 0.04$ per minute.

Total Session Cost$\  = \$ 0.15 + \$ 0.04\ $(number of minutes)

Exercises 7--16

7.  Let $x$ represent the number of minutes used and $y$ represent the
    total session cost in dollars. Construct a linear function that
    models the total session cost based on the number of minutes used.

8.  Using the linear function constructed in Exercise 7, determine the
    total session cost for sessions of $0$, $10$, $20$, $30$, $40$,
    $50$, and$\ 60\ $minutes, and fill in these values in the table
    below.

9.  Plot these points on the original graph in Exercise 1, and draw a
    line through these points. In what ways does the line that
    represents this second company's access plan differ from the line
    that represents the first company's access plan?

MP3 download sites are a popular forum for selling music. Different
sites offer pricing that depends on whether or not you want to purchase
an entire album or individual songs Ã  la carte. One site offers MP3
downloads of individual songs with the following price structure: a
$\$ 3$ fixed fee for a monthly subscription *plus* a charge of $\$ 0.25$
per song.

10. Using $x$ for the number of songs downloaded and $y$ for the total
    monthly cost in dollars, construct a linear function to model the
    relationship between the number of songs downloaded and the total
    monthly cost.

11. Using the linear function you wrote in Exercise 10, construct a
    table to record the total monthly cost (in dollars) for MP3
    downloads of $10\ $songs, $20\ $songs, and so on up to $100\ $songs.

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
                                      

                                      

                                      

                                      

                                      

                                      

                                      

                                      

                                      

                                      
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

12. Plot the $10\ $data points in the table on a coordinate plane. Let
    the$\ x$-axis represent the number of songs downloaded and the
    $y$-axis represent the total monthly cost (in dollars) for MP3
    downloads.

A band will be paid a flat fee for playing a concert. Additionally, the
band will receive a fixed amount for every ticket sold. If $40$ tickets
are sold, the band will be paid $\$ 200$. If $70\ $tickets are sold, the
band will be paid $\$ 260$.

13. Determine the rate of change.

14. Let $x$ represent the number of tickets sold and $y$ represent the
    amount the band will be paid in dollars. Construct a linear function
    to represent the relationship between the number of tickets sold and
    the amount the band will be paid.

15. What flat fee will the band be paid for playing the concert
    regardless of the number of tickets sold?

16. How much will the band receive for each ticket sold?

Lesson Summary

A linear function can be used to model a linear relationship between two
types of quantities. The graph of a linear function is a straight line.

A linear function can be constructed using a rate of change and an
initial value. It can be interpreted as an equation of a line in which:

- The rate of change is the slope of the line and describes how one
  quantity changes with respect to another quantity.

- The initial value is the $y$-intercept.

Problem Set

1.  Recall that Lenore was investigating two wireless access plans. Her
    friend in Europe says that he uses a plan in which he pays a monthly
    fee of $30$ euro plus $0.02$ euro per minute of use.

    a.  Construct a table of values for his plan's monthly cost based on
        $100$ minutes of use for the month, $200$ minutes of use, and so
        on up to $1,000$ minutes of use. (The charge of $0.02\ $euro per
        minute of use is equivalent to$\ 2$ euro per $100$ minutes of
        use.)

    b.  Plot these $10$ points on a carefully labeled graph, and draw
        the line that contains these points.

    c.  Let $x$ represent minutes of use and $y$ represent the total
        monthly cost in euro. Construct a linear function that
        determines monthly cost based on minutes of use.

    d.  Use the function to calculate the cost under this plan for $750$
        minutes of use. If this point were added to the graph, would it
        be above the line, below the line, or on the line?
