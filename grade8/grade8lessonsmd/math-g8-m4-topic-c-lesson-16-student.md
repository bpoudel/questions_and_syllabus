Exercise

Let's investigate concretely to see if the claim that we can find slope
between any two points is true.

a.  Select any two points on the line to label as $P$ and $R.$

b.  Identify the coordinates of points $P$ and $R.$

c.  Find the slope of the line using as many different points as you
    can. Identify your points, and show your work below.

Lesson Summary

The slope of a line can be calculated using *any* two points on the same
line because the slope triangles formed are similar, and corresponding
sides will be equal in ratio.

The *slope* of a non-vertical line in a coordinate plane that passes
through two different points is the number given by the difference in
$y$-coordinates of those points divided by the difference in the
corresponding $x$-coordinates.\
For two points $P\left( p_{1},p_{2} \right)$ and
$R\left( r_{1},r_{2} \right)$ on the line where $p_{1} \neq r_{1}$, the
slope of the line $m$ can be computed by the formula

$$m = \frac{p_{2} - r_{2}}{p_{1} - r_{1}}\ .$$

The slope of a vertical line is not defined.

Your teacher tells you that a line goes through the points
$\left( - 6,\frac{1}{2} \right)$ and $( - 4,3)$.

g.  Calculate the slope of this line.

h.  Do you think the slope will be the same if the order of the points
    is reversed? Verify by calculating the slope, and explain your
    result.

l.  Why do you think
    $m = \frac{\left( p_{2} - r_{2} \right)}{\left( p_{1} - r_{1} \right)} = \frac{\left( r_{2} - p_{2} \right)}{\left( r_{1} - p_{1} \right)}$?

    non-vertical. Consider the slope of a vertical line, $x = 2$. Select
    two points on the line to calculate slope. Based on your answer, why
    do you think the topic of slope focuses only on non-vertical lines?

Challenge:

A certain line has a slope of $\frac{1}{2}$. Name two points that may be
on the line.
