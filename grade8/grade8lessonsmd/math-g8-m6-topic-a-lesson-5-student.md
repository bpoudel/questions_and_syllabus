Lesson 5: Increasing and Decreasing Functions

Classwork

**Example 1: Nonlinear Functions in the Real World**

Not all real-world situations can be modeled by a linear function. There
are times when a nonlinear function is needed to describe the
relationship between two types of quantities. Compare the two scenarios:

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image1.png){width="3.9875in"
height="2.6347222222222224in"}Aleph is running at a constant rate on a
flat, paved road. The graph below represents the total distance he
covers with respect to time.

height="2.6256944444444446in"}Shannon is running on a flat, rocky trail
that eventually rises up a steep mountain. The graph below represents
the total distance she covers with respect to time.

Exercises 1--2

In your own words, describe what is happening as Aleph is running during
the following intervals of time.

$0$ to $15\ $minutes

$15$ to $30$ minutes

$30$ to $45$ minutes

$45$ to $60$ minutes

In your own words, describe what is happening as Shannon is running
during the following intervals of time.

$0$ to $15$ minutes

$15\ $to $30$ minutes

$30$ to $45$ minutes

$45$ to $60\ $minutes

**Example 2: Increasing and Decreasing Functions**

The rate of change of a function can provide useful information about
the relationship between two quantities. A linear function has a
constant rate of change. A nonlinear function has a variable rate of
change.

Exercises 3--5

Different breeds of dogs have different growth rates. A large breed dog
typically experiences a rapid growth rate from birth to age $6\ $months.
At that point, the growth rate begins to slow down until the dog reaches
full growth around$\ 2\ $years of age.

Lesson Summary

The graph of a function can be used to help describe the relationship
between the quantities it represents.

A linear function has a constant rate of change. A nonlinear function
does not have a constant rate of change.

- A function whose graph has a positive rate of change is an *increasing
  function*.

- A function whose graph has a negative rate of change is a *decreasing
  function*.

- Some functions may increase and decrease over different intervals.

Using the axes in Problem 7(b), create a story about the relationship
between two quantities.

Write a story about the relationship between two quantities. Any
quantities can be used (e.g., distance and time, money and hours, age
and growth). Be creative! Include keywords in your story such as
*increase* and *decrease* to describe the relationship.

Label each axis with the quantities of your choice, and sketch a graph
of the function that models the relationship described in the story.
