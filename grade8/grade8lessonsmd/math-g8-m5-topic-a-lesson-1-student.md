Lesson 1: The Concept of a Function

Classwork

**Example 1**

Suppose a moving object travels $256$ feet in $4$ seconds. Assume that
the object travels at a constant speed, that is, the motion of the
object can be described by a linear equation. Write a linear equation in
two variables to represent the situation, and use the equation to
predict how far the object has moved at the four times shown.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Number of seconds in motion       **Distance traveled in feet
  (**$\mathbf{x}$**)**                (**$\mathbf{y}$**)**
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  $$1$$                               

  $$2$$                               

  $$3$$                               

  $$4$$                               
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 2**

The object, a stone, is dropped from a height of $256$ feet. It takes
exactly $4$ seconds for the stone to hit the ground. How far does the
stone drop in the first $3$ seconds? What about the last $3$ seconds?
Can we assume constant speed in this situation? That is, can this
situation be expressed using a linear equation?

  **Number of seconds                 **Distance traveled in feet
  (**$\mathbf{x}$**)**                (**$\mathbf{y}$**)**

  $$1$$                               

  $$2$$                               

  $$3$$                               

  $$4$$

1.  Name two predictions you can make from this table.

2.  Name a prediction that would require more information.

3.  What is the average speed of the object between $0$ and $3$ seconds?
    How does this compare to the average speed calculated over the same
    interval in Example 1?

    $$Average\ Speed\mathbf{=}\frac{distance\ traveled\ over\ a\ given\ time\ interval}{time\ interval}$$

4.  Take a closer look at the data for the falling stone by answering
    the questions below.

    a.  How many feet did the stone drop between $0$ and $1$ second?

    b.  How many feet did the stone drop between $1$ and $2$ seconds?

    c.  How many feet did the stone drop between $2$ and $3$ seconds?

    d.  How many feet did the stone drop between $3$ and $4$ seconds?

    e.  Compare the distances the stone dropped from one time interval
        to the next. What do you notice?

5.  What is the average speed of the stone in each interval $0.5$
    second? For example, the average speed over the interval from $3.5$
    seconds to $4\ $seconds is

    $$\frac{distance\ traveled\ over\ a\ given\ time\ interval}{time\ interval} = \frac{256 - 196}{4 - 3.5} = \frac{\ \ \ \ 60\ \ \ }{0.5} = 120;120\ feet\ per\ second$$

    Repeat this process for every half-second interval. Then answer the
    question that follows.

| a.  Interval between $0$ and      | b.  Interval between $0.5$ and    |

h.  Compare the average speed between each time interval. What do you
    notice?

Lesson Summary

A *function* is a rule that assigns to each value of one quantity a
single value of a second quantity. Even though we might not have a
formula for that rule, we see that functions do arise in real-life
situations

Problem Set

A ball is thrown across the field from point $A$ to point $B.$ It hits
the ground at point $B.$ The path of the ball is shown in the diagram
below. The $x$-axis shows the horizontal distance the ball travels in
feet, and the $y$-axis shows the height of the ball in feet. Use the
diagram to complete parts (a)--(f).

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image1.png){width="5.387273622047244in"
height="1.9686067366579179in"}

a.  Suppose point $A$ is approximately $6$ feet above ground and that at
    time $t = 0$ the ball is at point $A.$ Suppose the length of $OB$ is
    approximately $88$ feet. Include this information on the diagram.

b.  Suppose that after $1$ second, the ball is at its highest point of
    $22$ feet (above point $C)\ $and has traveled a horizontal distance
    of $44$ feet. What are the approximate coordinates of the ball at
    the following values of\
    $t:$ $0.25$,$\ 0.5$, $0.75$, $1$, $1.25$, $1.5$, $1.75$, and $2.$

c.  Use your answer from part (b) to write two predictions.

d.  What is happening to the ball when it has coordinates $(88,\ 0)$?

e.  Why do you think the ball is at point $(0,\ 6)$ when $t = 0$? In
    other words, why isn't the height of the ball $0$?

f.  Does the graph allow us to make predictions about the height of the
    ball at all points?
