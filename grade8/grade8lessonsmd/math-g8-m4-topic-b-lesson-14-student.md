Lesson Summary

In a coordinate plane with perpendicular $x$- and $y$-axes, a *vertical
line* is either the $y$-axis or any other line parallel to the $y$-axis.
The graph of the linear equation in two variables $ax + by = c$, where
$a = 1$ and $b = 0$, is the graph of the equation $x = c$. The graph of
$x = c$ is the vertical line that passes through the point $(c,0)$.

In a coordinate plane with perpendicular $x$- and $y$-axes, a
*horizontal line* is either the $x$-axis or any other line parallel to
the $x$-axis. The graph of the linear equation in two variables
$ax + by = c$, where $a = 0$ and $b = 1$, is the graph of the equation
$y = c$. The graph of $y = c$ is the horizontal line that passes through
the point $(0,c)$.

Problem Set

Graph the two-variable linear equation $ax + by = c$, where $a = 0$,
$b = 1$, and $c = - 4$.

Graph the two-variable linear equation $ax + by = c$, where $a = 1$,
$b = 0$, and $c = 9$.

Graph the linear equation$\ y = 7$.

Graph the linear equation $x = 1$.

Explain why the graph of a linear equation in the form of $y = c$ is the
horizontal line, parallel to the $x$-axis passing through the point
$(0,\ c)$.

Explain why there is only one line with the equation $y = c$ that passes
through the point $(0,\ c).$
