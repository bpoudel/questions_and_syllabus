Complete the table below, and graph the data on a coordinate plane.
Compare the graphs from Problems 1 and 2. What do you notice? If you
could write a rule to describe the function of the rate of change of the
water level of the cone, what might the rule include?

Describe, intuitively, the rate of change of the water level if the
container being filled were a cylinder. Would we get the same results as
with the cone? Why or why not? Sketch a graph of what filling the
cylinder might look like, and explain how the graph relates to your
answer.

Describe, intuitively, the rate of change if the container being filled
were a sphere. Would we get the same results as with the cone? Why or
why not?
