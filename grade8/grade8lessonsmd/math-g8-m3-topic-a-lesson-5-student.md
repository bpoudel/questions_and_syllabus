Lesson 5: First Consequences of FTS

Classwork

Exercise 1

In the diagram below, points $P$ and $Q$ have been dilated from center
$O$ by scale factor $r$. $\ \overline{PQ} \parallel \overline{P'Q'}$,
$|PQ| = 5\ cm$, and $|P'Q'| = 10\ cm$.

Determine the scale factor $r$.

Locate the center $O$ of dilation. Measure the segments to verify that
$|OP'| = r|OP|$ and $|OQ'| = r|OQ|$*.* Show your work below.

**Exercise 2**

In the diagram below, you are given center $O$ and ray
$\overrightarrow{OA}$. Point $A$ is dilated by a scale factor $r = 4$.
Use what you know about FTS to find the location of point $A'$.

Exercise 3

In the diagram below, you are given center $O$ and ray
$\overrightarrow{OA}$. Point $A$ is dilated by a scale factor
$r = \frac{5}{12}$. Use what you know about FTS to find the location of
point $A'$.

Lesson Summary

Converse of the fundamental theorem of similarity:

*If lines* $PQ$ *and* $P'Q'$ *are parallel and* $|P'Q'| = r|PQ|,$ *then
from a center* $O$*,* $P' = Dilation(P)$*,* $Q' = Dilation(Q)$*,*
$|OP'| = r|OP|,$ *and* $|OQ'| = r|OQ|$*.*

To find the coordinates of a dilated point, we must use what we know
about FTS, dilation, and scale factor.

Problem Set

Dilate point $A,$ located at $(3,\ 4)$ from center $O,$ by a scale
factor $r = \frac{5}{3}$.

What is the precise location of point $A'$?

Dilate point $A,$ located at $(9,\ 7)$ from center $O,$ by a scale
factor $r = \frac{4}{9}$. Then, dilate point $B,$ located at $(9,\ 5)$
from center $O$, by a scale factor of $r = \frac{4}{9}$. What are the
coordinates of points $A'$ and $B'$? Explain.
