Lesson Summary

The formula to find the volume, $V$, of a right circular cylinder is
$V = \pi r^{2}h = Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base.

The formula to find the volume of a cone is directly related to that of
the cylinder. Given a right circular cylinder with radius $r$ and height
$h,$ the volume of a cone with those same dimensions is one-third of the
cylinder. The formula for the volume, $V,$ of a circular cone is
$V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2}h$. More generally, the volume formula for a
general cone is $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh,$ where $B$ is the area of the base.

9.  Oscar wants to fill with water a bucket that is the shape of a right
    circular cylinder. It has a $6$-inch radius and\
    $12$-inch height. He uses a shovel that has the shape of a right
    circular cone with a $3$-inch radius and $4$-inch height. How many
    shovelfuls will it take Oscar to fill the bucket up level with the
    top?

10. A cylindrical tank (with dimensions shown below) contains water that
    is $1$-foot deep. If water is poured into the tank at a constant
    rate of $20\ \frac{{ft}^{3}}{\min}$ for $20\ \min$., will the tank
    overflow? Use $3.14$ to estimate $\pi.$
