Lesson Summary

For rational numbers, there is no need to guess and check in which
interval of tenths, hundredths, or thousandths the number will lie.

For example, to determine where the fraction $\frac{1}{8}$ lies in the
interval of tenths, compute using the following inequality:

+--------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| $${\frac{m}{10} < \frac{1}{8} < \frac{m + 1}{10} | Use the denominator of $10$ because we need to     |
| }{m < \frac{10}{8} < m + 1                       | find the tenths digit of $\frac{1}{8}$.            |
| }{m < 1\frac{1}{4} < m + 1}$$                    |                                                    |
|                                                  | Multiply through by $10$.                          |
|                                                  |                                                    |
|                                                  | Simplify the fraction $\frac{10}{8}$.              |
+==================================================+====================================================+

The last inequality implies that $m = 1$ and $m + 1 = 2$ because
$1 < 1\frac{1}{4} < 2$. Then, the tenths digit of the decimal expansion
of $\frac{1}{8}$ is $1$.

To find in which interval of hundredths $\frac{1}{8}\ $lies, we seek
consecutive integers $m$ and $m + 1$ so that

$$\frac{1}{10} + \frac{m}{100} < \frac{1}{8} < \frac{1}{10} + \ \frac{m + 1}{100}.$$

This is equivalent to

$$\frac{m}{100} < \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{10} < \ \frac{m + 1}{100},$$

so we compute
$\frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{80} = \frac{1}{40}$. We have

$$\frac{m}{100} < \frac{1}{40} < \frac{m + 1}{100}.$$

Multiplying through by $100$ gives

$$m < \frac{10}{4} < m + 1.$$

The last inequality implies that $m = 2$ and $m + 1 = 3$ because
$2 < 2\frac{1}{2} < 3.$ Then, the hundredths digit of the decimal
expansion of $\frac{1}{8}$ is $2$.

We can continue the process until the decimal expansion is complete or
until we suspect a repeating pattern that we can verify.
