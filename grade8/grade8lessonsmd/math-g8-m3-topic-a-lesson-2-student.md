Exercise

Given center $O$ and triangle $ABC$, dilate the triangle from center $O$
with a scale factor $r = 3$.

Note that the triangle $ABC$ is made up of segments $AB$, $BC$, and
$CA$. Were the dilated images of these segments still segments?

Measure the length of the segments $AB$ and $A'B'$. What do you notice?
(Think about the definition of dilation.)

Verify the claim you made in part (b) by measuring and comparing the
lengths of segments $BC$ and $B'C'$ and segments $CA$ and $C'A'$. What
does this mean in terms of the segments formed between dilated points?

Measure $\angle ABC$ and $\angle A'B'C'$. What do you notice?

Verify the claim you made in part (d) by measuring and comparing the
following sets of angles: (1) $\angle BCA$ and $\angle B'C'A'$ and (2)
$\angle CAB$ and $\angle C'A'B'$. What does that mean in terms of
dilations with respect to angles and their degrees?

Lesson Summary

Dilations map lines to lines, rays to rays, and segments to segments.
Dilations map angles to angles of the same degree.

Problem Set

Use a ruler to dilate the following figure from center $O$, with scale
factor $r = \frac{1}{2}$.

Dilate the same figure, $ABCDE$, from a new center, $O'$, with scale
factor $r = 2$. Use double primes ($A''B''C''D''E''$) to distinguish
this image from the original.

What rigid motion, or sequence of rigid motions, would
map$\ A''B''C''D''E''$ *to* $A'B'C'D'E'$?

Given center $O$ and triangle $ABC$, dilate the figure from center $O$
by a scale factor of $r = \frac{1}{4}$. Label the dilated triangle
$A'B'C'$*.*

A line segment $AB$ undergoes a dilation. Based on today's lesson, what
is the image of the segment?

$\angle GHI$ measures $78{^\circ}$. After a dilation, what is the
measure of $\angle G'H'I'$? How do you know?
