Lesson 6: Solutions of a Linear Equation

Classwork

Exercises

Find the value of $x$ that makes the equation true.

1.  $17 - 5(2x - 9) = - ( - 6x + 10) + 4$

2.  $- (x - 7) + \frac{5}{3} = 2(x + 9)$

3.  $\frac{4}{9} + 4(x - 1) = \frac{28}{9} - (x - 7x) + 1$

4.  $5(3x + 4) - 2x = 7x - 3( - 2x + 11)$

5.  $7x - (3x + 5) - 8 = \frac{1}{2}(8x + 20) - 7x + 5$

6.  Write at least three equations that have no solution.

Lesson Summary

The distributive property is used to expand expressions. For example,
the expression $2(3x - 10)$ is rewritten as $6x - 20$ after the
distributive property is applied.

The distributive property is used to simplify expressions. For example,
the expression $7x + 11x$ is rewritten as $(7 + 11)x$ and $18x$ after
the distributive property is applied.

The distributive property is applied only to terms within a group:

$4(3x + 5) - 2 = 12x + 20 - 2$.

Notice that the term $- 2$ is not part of the group and, therefore, not
multiplied by $4.$

When an equation is transformed into an untrue sentence, such as
$5 \neq 11$, we say the equation has *no solution*.

Problem Set

Transform the equation if necessary, and then solve it to find the value
of $x$ that makes the equation true.

1.  $x - (9x - 10) + 11 = 12x + 3\left( - 2x + \frac{1}{3} \right)$

<!-- -->

7.  $7x + 8\left( x + \frac{1}{4} \right) = 3(6x - 9) - 8$

8.  $- 4x - 2(8x + 1) = - ( - 2x - 10)$

9.  $11(x + 10) = 132$

10. $37x + \frac{1}{2} - \left( x + \frac{1}{4} \right) = 9(4x - 7) + 5$

11. $3(2x - 14) + x = 15 - ( - 9x - 5)$

12. $8(2x + 9) = 56$
