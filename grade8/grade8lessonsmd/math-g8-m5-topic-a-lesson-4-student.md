Lesson 4: More Examples of Functions

Classwork

**Example 1**

Classify each of the functions described below as either discrete or not
discrete.

a)  The function that assigns to each whole number the cost of buying
    that many cans of beans in a particular grocery store.

b)  The function that assigns to each time of day one Wednesday the
    temperature of Sammy's fever at that time.

c)  The function that assigns to each real number its first digit.

d)  The function that assigns to each day in the year 2015 my height at
    noon that day.

e)  The function that assigns to each moment in the year 2015 my height
    at that moment.

f)  The function that assigns to each color the first letter of the name
    of that color.

g)  The function that assigns the number $23$ to each and every real
    number between $20$ and $30.6$.

h)  The function that assigns the word YES to every yes/no question.

i)  The function that assigns to each height directly above the North
    Pole the temperature of the air at that height right at this very
    moment.

**Example 2**

Water flows from a faucet into a bathtub at a constant rate of $7$
gallons of water every $2$ minutes. Regard the volume of water
accumulated in the tub as a function of the number of minutes the faucet
has be on. Is this function discrete or not discrete?

**Example 3**

You have just been served freshly made soup that is so hot that it
cannot be eaten. You measure the temperature of the soup, and it is
$210{^\circ}F$. Since $212{^\circ}F$ is boiling, there is no way it can
safely be eaten yet. One minute after receiving the soup, the
temperature has dropped to $203{^\circ}F$. If you assume that the rate
at which the soup cools is constant, write an equation that would
describe the temperature of the soup over time.

**Example 4**

Consider the function that assigns to each of nine baseball players,
numbered 1 through 9, his height. The data for this function is given
below. Call the function $\mathbf{G}$.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
          **Player Number**                       **Height**

                $$6$$                               $6'8$″

                $$7$$                               $5'9$″

                $$8$$                              $5'10$″

                $$9$$                               $6'2$″

1.  At a certain school, each bus in its fleet of buses can transport 35
    students. Let $B$ be the function that assigns to each count of
    students the number of buses needed to transport that many students
    on a field trip.

b.  Is this function discrete?

Lesson Summary

Functions are classified as either discrete or not discrete.

Discrete functions admit only individually separate input values (such
as whole numbers of students, or words of the English language).
Functions that are not discrete admit any input value within a range of
values (fractional values, for example).

Functions that describe motion or smooth changes over time, for example,
are typically not discrete.
