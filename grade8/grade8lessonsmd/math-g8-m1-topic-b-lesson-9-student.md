Lesson 9: Scientific Notation

Classwork

A positive, finite decimal $s\ $is said to be written in scientific
notation if it is expressed as a product $d \times 10^{n}$, where $d$ is
a finite decimal so that $1 \leq d < 10$, and $n$ is an integer.

The integer $n$ is called the order of magnitude of the decimal
$d \times 10^{n}$.

Are the following numbers written in scientific notation? If not, state
the reason.

    Express your answer in scientific notation.

b.  What is the sum of the population of the three least populous
    states? Express your answer in scientific notation.

c.  Approximately how many times greater is the total population of

Exercise 9

All planets revolve around the sun in elliptical orbits. Uranus's
furthest distance from the sun is approximately
$3.004 \times 10^{9}\ km$, and its closest distance is approximately
$2.749 \times 10^{9}\ km$. Using this information, what is the average
distance of Uranus from the sun?

Problem Set

Write the number $68,127,000,000,000,000$ in scientific notation. Which
of the two representations of this number do you prefer? Explain.

Here are the masses of the so-called inner planets of the solar system.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mercury:                            Earth: $5.9722 \times 10^{24}\ kg$
  $3.3022 \times 10^{23}\ kg$         
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Venus: $4.8685 \times 10^{24}\ kg$  Mars: $6.4185 \times 10^{23}\ kg$

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
