Lesson 12: Choice of Unit

Classwork

Exercise 1

A certain brand of MP3 player will display how long it will take to play
through its entire music library. If the maximum number of songs the MP3
player can hold is $1,000\ $(and the average song length is $4$
minutes), would you want the time displayed in terms of seconds-, days-,
or years-worth of music? Explain.

Exercise 2

You have been asked to make frosted cupcakes to sell at a school
fundraiser. Each frosted cupcake contains about $20\ $ grams of sugar.
Bake sale coordinators expect $500$ people will attend the event. Assume
everyone who attends will buy a cupcake; does it make sense to buy sugar
in grams, pounds, or tons? Explain.

Exercise 3

The seafloor spreads at a rate of approximately $10\ cm$ per year. If
you were to collect data on the spread of the seafloor each week, which
unit should you use to record your data? Explain.

The gigaelectronvolt, $\frac{GeV}{c^{2}}$ , is what particle physicists
use as the unit of mass.

1 gigaelectronvolt = $1.783\  \times \ 10^{- 27}\ kg$

Mass of $1$ proton = $1.672\ 622\  \times 10^{- 27}\ kg$

Exercise 4

Show that the mass of a proton is $0.938\frac{GeV}{c^{2}}$ .

In popular science writing, a commonly used unit is the light-year, or
the [distance]{.underline} light travels in one year\
(note: one year is defined as $365.25$ days).

$$1\text{ light-year} = 9,460,730,472,580.800\ km \approx 9.46073 \times 10^{12}\ km$$

Exercise 5

The distance of the nearest star (Proxima Centauri) to the sun is
approximately $4.013\ 336\ 473 \times 10^{13}\ km$. Show that Proxima
Centauri is $4.2421$ light-years from the sun.

Exploratory Challenge 2

Suppose you are researching atomic diameters and find that credible
sources provided the diameters of five different atoms as shown in the
table below. All measurements are in centimeters.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  $$1 \times 10^{- 8}$$   $$1 \times 10^{- 12}$$   $$5 \times 10^{- 8}$$   $$5 \times 10^{- 10}$$   $$5.29 \times 10^{- 11}$$
  ----------------------- ------------------------ ----------------------- ------------------------ ---------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 6

What new unit might you introduce in order to discuss the differences in
diameter measurements?

Exercise 7

Name your unit, and explain why you chose it.

Exercise 8

Using the unit you have defined, rewrite the five diameter measurements.

Problem Set

Verify the claim that, in terms of gigaelectronvolts, the mass of an
electron is $0.000511$.

The maximum distance between Earth and the sun is
$1.52098232 \times 10^{8}\ km$, and the minimum distance is
$1.47098290 \times 10^{8}\ km$.[^1] What is the average distance between
Earth and the sun in scientific notation?

Suppose you measure the following masses in terms of kilograms:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  $$2.6 \times 10^{21}$$              $$9.04 \times 10^{23}$$
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  $$8.82 \times 10^{23}$$             $$2.3 \times 10^{18}$$

  $$1.8 \times 10^{12}$$              $$2.103 \times 10^{22}$$

  $$8.1 \times 10^{20}$$              $$6.23 \times 10^{18}$$

  $$6.723 \times 10^{19}$$            $$1.15 \times 10^{20}$$

  $$7.07 \times 10^{21}$$             $$7.210 \times 10^{29}$$

  $$5.11 \times 10^{25}$$             $$7.35 \times 10^{24}$$

  $$7.8 \times 10^{19}$$              $$5.82 \times 10^{26}$$
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What new unit might you introduce in order to aid discussion of the
masses in this problem? Name your unit, and express it using some power
of $10$. Rewrite each number using your newly defined unit.
