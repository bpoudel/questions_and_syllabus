Exercises

Is the equation a true statement when$\ x = - 3$? In other words, is
$- 3$ a solution to the equation\
$6x + 5 = 5x + 8 + 2x$? Explain.

Does $x = 12$ satisfy the equation
$16 - \frac{1}{2}x = \frac{3}{4}x + 1$? Explain.

Chad solved the equation$\ 24x + 4 + 2x = 3(10x - 1)$ and is claiming
that $x = 2\ $makes the equation true. Is Chad correct? Explain.

Lisa solved the equation $x + 6 = 8 + 7x$ and claimed that the solution
is $x = - \frac{1}{3}$. Is she correct? Explain.

Angel transformed the following equation from $6x + 4 - x = 2(x + 1)$ to
$10 = 2(x + 1)$. He then stated that the solution to the equation is
$x = 4$. Is he correct? Explain.

Claire was able to verify that $x = 3$ was a solution to her teacher's
linear equation, but the equation got erased from the board. What might
the equation have been? Identify as many equations as you can with a
solution of $x = 3.$

Does an equation always have a solution? Could you come up with an
equation that does not have a solution?

Lesson Summary

An equation is a statement about equality between two expressions. If
the expression on the left side of the equal sign has the same value as
the expression on the right side of the equal sign, then you have a true
equation.

A solution of a linear equation in $x$ is a number, such that when all
instances of $x$ are replaced with the number, the left side will equal
the right side. For example, $2$ is a solution to $3x + 4 = x + 8$
because when $x = 2$, the left side of the equation is

$${3x + 4 = 3(2) + 4
}{= 6 + 4
}{= 10,}$$

and the right side of the equation is

$${x + 8 = 2 + 8
}{= 10.}$$

Since $10 = 10$, then $x = 2$ is a solution to the linear equation
$3x + 4 = x + 8$.

Problem Set

Explain.

Is $- 5$ a solution to the equation $6x + 5 = 5x + 8 + 2x$? Explain.

Does $x = 1.6\ $satisfy the equation $6 - 4x = - \frac{x}{4}$? Explain.

Use the linear equation $3(x + 1) = 3x + 3\ $to answer parts (a)--(d).

a.  Does $x = 5$ satisfy the equation above? Explain.

b.  Is $x = - 8$ a solution of the equation above? Explain.

d.  What interesting fact about the equation $3(x + 1) = 3x + 3$ is
    illuminated by the answers to parts (a), (b), and (c)? Why do you
    think this is true?
