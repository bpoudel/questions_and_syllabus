Lesson Summary

When the graphs of a system of linear equations are sketched, and if
they are not parallel lines, then the point of intersection of the lines
of the graph represents the solution to the system. Two distinct lines
intersect at most at one point, if they intersect. The coordinates of
that point $(x,\ y)$ represent values that make both equations of the
system true.

Example: The system $\left\{ \begin{array}{r}
x + y = 3 \\
x - y = 5
\end{array} \right.\ $ graphs as shown below.

The lines intersect at $(4,\  - 1)$. That means the equations in the
system are true when $x = 4$ and $y = - 1$.

$${x + y = 3
}{4 + ( - 1) = 3
}{3 = 3}$$

$${x - y = 5
}{4 - ( - 1) = 5
}{5 = 5}$$
