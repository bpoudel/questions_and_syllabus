is given, and a question is asked about it. If necessary, use a table to
organize pairs of inputs and outputs, and then plot each on a coordinate
plane to help answer the question.

Lesson Summary

One way to determine if a function is linear or nonlinear is to inspect
average rates of change using a table of values. If these average rates
of change are not constant, then the function is not linear.

Another way is to examine the graph of the function. If all the points
on the graph do not lie on a common line, then the function is not
linear.

If a function is described by an equation different from one equivalent
to $y = mx + b$ for some fixed values $m$ and $b$, then the function is
not linear.
