**Example 1: Housing Costs**

Let's look at some data from one midwestern city that indicate the sizes
and sale prices of various houses sold in this city.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   **Size (square        **Price          **Size (square        **Price
       feet)**         (dollars)**            feet)**         (dollars)**
  ----------------- ----------------- -- ----------------- -----------------
      $$5,232$$       $$1,050,000$$          $$1,196$$        $$144,900$$

      $$1,875$$        $$179,900$$           $$1,719$$        $$149,900$$

      $$1,031$$        $$84,900$$             $$956$$         $$59,900$$

      $$1,437$$        $$269,900$$            $$991$$         $$149,900$$

      $$4,400$$        $$799,900$$           $$1,312$$        $$154,900$$

      $$2,000$$        $$209,900$$           $$4,417$$        $$659,999$$

      $$2,132$$        $$224,900$$           $$3,664$$        $$669,000$$

Exercises 1--6

1.  What can you tell about the price of large homes compared to the
    price of small homes from the table?

2.  Use the scatter plot to answer the following questions.

    Does the scatter plot seem to support the statement that larger
    houses tend to cost more? Explain your thinking.

    What is the cost of the most expensive house, and where is that
    point on the scatter plot?

    Some people might consider a given amount of money and then predict
    what size house they could buy. Others might consider what size
    house they want and then predict how much it would cost. How would
    you use the scatter plot in Example 1?

    Estimate the cost of a $3,000$-square-foot house.

    Do you think a line would provide a reasonable way to describe how
    price and size are related? How could you use a line to predict the
    price of a house if you are given its size?

3.  Draw a line in the plot that you think would fit the trend in the
    data.

4.  Use your line to answer the following questions:

    What is your prediction of the price of a $3,000$-square-foot house?

    What is the prediction of the price of a $1,500$-square-foot house?

5.  Consider the following general strategies students use for drawing a
    line. Do you think they represent a good strategy for drawing a line
    that fits the data? Explain why or why not, or draw a line for the
    scatter plot using the strategy that would indicate why it is or why
    it is not a good strategy.

    Laure thought she might draw her line using the very first point
    (farthest to the left) and the very last point (farthest to the
    right) in the scatter plot.

    Phil wants to be sure that he has the same number of points above
    and below the line.

    Sandie thought she might try to get a line that had the most points
    right on it.

    Maree decided to get her line as close to as many of the points as
    possible.

6.  Based on the strategies discussed in Exercise 5, would you change
    how you draw a line through the points? Explain your answer.

**Example 2: Deep Water**

Does the current in the water go faster or slower when the water is
shallow? The data on the depth and velocity of the Columbia River at
various locations in Washington State listed below can help you think
about the answer.

**Depth and Velocity in the Columbia River, Washington State**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Depth (feet)**                    **Velocity (feet/second)**
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  $$0.7$$                             $$1.55$$

  $$2.0$$                             $$1.11$$

  $$2.6$$                             $$1.42$$

  $$3.3$$                             $$1.39$$

  $$4.6$$                             $$1.39$$

  $$5.9$$                             $$1.14$$

  $$7.3$$                             $$0.91$$

  $$8.6$$                             $$0.59$$

  $$9.9$$                             $$0.59$$

  $$10.6$$                            $$0.41$$

  $$11.2$$                            $$0.22$$

a.  What can you tell about the relationship between the depth and
    velocity by looking at the numbers in\
    the table?

b.  If you were to make a scatter plot of the data, which variable would
    you put on the horizontal axis, and why?

Exercises 7--9

7.  A scatter plot of the Columbia River data is shown below.

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image2.wmf){width="4.450680227471566in"
height="2.8608694225721787in"}

Choose a data point in the scatter plot, and describe what it means in
terms of the context.

Based on the scatter plot, describe the relationship between velocity
and depth.

How would you explain the relationship between the velocity and depth of
the water?

If the river is two feet deep at a certain spot, how fast do you think
the current would be? Explain your reasoning.

8.  Consider the following questions:

    If you draw a line to represent the trend in the plot, will it make
    it easier to predict the velocity of the water if you know the
    depth? Why or why not?

    Draw a line that you think does a reasonable job of modeling the
    trend on the scatter plot in Exercise 7. Use the line to predict the
    velocity when the water is $8$ feet deep.

9.  Use the line to predict the velocity for a depth of $8.6$ feet. How
    far off was your prediction from the actual observed velocity for
    the location that had a depth of $8.6$ feet?

Lesson Summary

- When constructing a scatter plot, the variable that you want to
  predict (i.e., the dependent or response variable) goes on the
  vertical axis. The independent variable (i.e., the variable not
  related to other variables) goes on the horizontal axis.

- When the pattern in a scatter plot is approximately linear, a line can
  be used to describe the linear relationship.

- A line that describes the relationship between a dependent variable
  and an independent variable can be used to make predictions of the
  value of the dependent variable given a value of the independent
  variable.

- When informally fitting a line, you want to find a line for which the
  points in the scatter plot tend to be closest.

What do you observe from looking at the data in the table?

Look at the scatter plot below. A line is drawn to fit the data. The
plot in the Exit Ticket had the mean July temperatures for the cities on
the horizontal axis. How is this plot different, and what does it mean
for the way you think about the relationship between the two
variables---temperature and rain?

**July Rainfall and Temperatures in Selected Midwestern Cities**

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image3.png){width="3.6956517935258093in"
height="2.3826082677165354in"}

The line has been drawn to model the relationship between the amount of
rain and the temperature in those midwestern cities. Use the line to
predict the mean July temperature for a midwestern city that has a mean
of $32$ inches of rain per year.

For which of the cities in the sample does the line do the worst job of
predicting the mean temperature? The best? Explain your reasoning with
as much detail as possible.

The scatter plot below shows the results of a survey of eighth-grade
students who were asked to report the number of hours per week they
spend playing video games and the typical number of hours they sleep
each night.

**Mean Hours Sleep per Night Versus Mean Hours Playing Video Games per
Week**

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image4.wmf){width="4.14in"
height="2.65in"}

What trend do you observe in the data?

What was the fewest number of hours per week that students who were
surveyed spent playing video games? The most?

What was the fewest number of hours per night that students who were
surveyed typically slept? The most?

Draw a line that seems to fit the trend in the data, and find its
equation. Use the line to predict the number of hours of sleep for a
student who spends about $15$ hours per week playing video games.

10. Scientists can take very good pictures of alligators from airplanes
    or helicopters. Scientists in Florida are interested in studying the
    relationship between the length and the weight of alligators in the
    waters around Florida.

    Would it be easier to collect data on length or weight? Explain your
    thinking.

    Use your answer to decide which variable you would want to put on
    the horizontal axis and which variable you might want to predict.

11. Scientists captured a small sample of alligators and measured both
    their length (in inches) and weight (in pounds). Torre used their
    data to create the following scatter plot and drew a line to capture
    the trend in the data. She and Steve then had a discussion about the
    way the line fit the data. What do you think they were discussing,
    and why?
