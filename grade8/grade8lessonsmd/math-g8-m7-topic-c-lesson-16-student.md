Lesson Summary

The converse of the Pythagorean theorem states that if a triangle with
side lengths $a$,$\ b$, and $c$ satisfies\
$a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$, then the triangle is a right triangle.

The converse can be proven using concepts related to congruence.

15. Corey found the hypotenuse of a right triangle with leg lengths of
    $2$ and $3$ to be $\sqrt{13}$. Corey claims that since
    $\sqrt{13} = 3.61$ when estimating to two decimal digits, that a
    triangle with leg lengths of $2$ and $3$ and a hypotenuse of $3.61$
    is a right triangle. Is he correct? Explain.
