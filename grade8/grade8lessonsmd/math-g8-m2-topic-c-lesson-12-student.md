Lesson 12: Angles Associated with Parallel Lines

Classwork

Exploratory Challenge 1

In the figure below, $L_{1}$ is not parallel to $L_{2}$, and $m$ is a
transversal. Use a protractor to measure angles 1--8.\
Which, if any, are equal in measure? Explain why. (Use your transparency
if needed.)

What did you notice about the measures of $\angle 1$ and $\angle 5$? Why
do you think this is so? (Use your transparency if needed.)

What did you notice about the measures of $\angle 3$ and $\angle 7$? Why
do you think this is so? (Use your transparency if needed.) Are there
any other pairs of angles with this same relationship? If so, list them.

What did you notice about the measures of $\angle 4$ and $\angle 6$? Why
do you think this is so? (Use your transparency if needed.) Is there
another pair of angles with this same relationship?

When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, any corresponding angles,
any alternate interior angles, and any alternate exterior angles are
equal in measure. If the lines are not parallel, then the angles are not
equal in measure.
