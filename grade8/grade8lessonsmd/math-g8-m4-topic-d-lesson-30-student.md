Mathematical Modeling Exercise

(1) If $t$ is a number, what is the degree in Fahrenheit that
    corresponds to $t{^\circ}C$?

(2) If $t$ is a number, what is the degree in Fahrenheit that
    corresponds to $( - t){^\circ}C$?

Exercises

Determine the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature for the given Celsius
temperatures in Exercises 1--5.

How many degrees Fahrenheit is $25{^\circ}C$?

How many degrees Fahrenheit is $42{^\circ}C$?

How many degrees Fahrenheit is $94{^\circ}C$?

How many degrees Fahrenheit is $63{^\circ}C$?

How many degrees Fahrenheit is $t{^\circ}C$?

Problem Set

Does the equation $t{^\circ}C = (32 + 1.8t){^\circ}F$ work for any
rational number $t$? Check that it does with $t = 8\frac{2}{3}$ and\
$t = - 8\frac{2}{3}$.

Knowing that
$t{^\circ}C = \left( 32 + \frac{9}{5}t \right){^\circ}F\ $for any
rational $t$, show that for any rational number $d$,
$d{^\circ}F = \left( \frac{5}{9}(d - 32) \right){^\circ}C$.

Drake was trying to write an equation to help him predict the cost of
his monthly phone bill. He is charged $\$ 35$ just for having a phone,
and his only additional expense comes from the number of texts that he
sends. He is charged $\$ 0.05$ for each text. Help Drake out by
completing parts (a)--(f).

How much was his phone bill in July when he sent $750\ $texts?

How much was his phone bill in August when he sent $823$ texts?

How much was his phone bill in September when he sent $579$ texts?

Let $y$ represent the total cost of Drake's phone bill. Write an
equation that represents the total cost of his phone bill in October if
he sends $t$ texts.

Another phone plan charges $\$ 20$ for having a phone and $\$ 0.10$ per
text. Let $y$ represent the total cost of the phone bill for sending $t$
texts. Write an equation to represent his total bill.

Write your equations in parts (d) and (e) as a system of linear
equations, and solve. Interpret the meaning of the solution in terms of
the phone bill.
