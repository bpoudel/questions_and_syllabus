Problem Set

Lesson Summary

The formula to find the volume of a sphere is directly related to that
of the right circular cylinder. Given a right circular cylinder with
radius $r$ and height $h$, which is equal to $2r$, a sphere with the
same radius $r$ has a volume that is exactly two-thirds of the cylinder.

Therefore, the volume of a sphere with radius $r$ has a volume given by
the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}$.

A scoop of ice cream is considered a perfect sphere and has a $2$-inch
diameter. A cone has a $2$-inch diameter and a height of $4.5$ inches. A
cup, considered a right circular cylinder, has a $3$-inch diameter and a
height of $2$ inches.

a.  Determine the volume of each choice. Use $3.14$ to
    approximate$\ \pi$.

b.  Determine which choice is the best value for her money. Explain your
    reasoning.
