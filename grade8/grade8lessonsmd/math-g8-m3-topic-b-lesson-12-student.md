Lesson 12: Modeling Using Similarity

Classwork

**Example**

Not all flagpoles are perfectly *upright* (i.e., perpendicular to the
ground). Some are oblique (i.e., neither parallel nor at a right angle,
slanted). Imagine an oblique flagpole in front of an abandoned building.
The question is, can we use sunlight and shadows to determine the length
of the flagpole?

height="1.5939140419947506in"}

Assume that we know the following information: The length of the shadow
of the flagpole is $15$ feet. There is a mark on the flagpole $3$ feet
from its base. The length of the shadow of this three-foot portion of
the flagpole is $1.7$ feet.

Mathematical Modeling Exercises 1--3

1.  You want to determine the approximate height of one of the tallest
    buildings in the city. You are told that if you place a mirror some
    distance from yourself so that you can see the top of the building
    in the mirror, then you can indirectly measure the height using
    similar triangles. Let point$\ O$ be the location of the mirror so
    that the person shown can see the top of the building.

    height="3.7134831583552055in"}

    a.  Explain why $\bigtriangleup ABO\ \sim \bigtriangleup STO$.

    b.  Label the diagram with the following information: The distance
        from eye level straight down to the ground is $5.3$ feet. The
        distance from the person to the mirror is $7.2$ feet. The
        distance from the person to the base of the building is $1,750$
        feet. The height of the building is represented by $x$.

    c.  What is the distance from the mirror to the building?

    d.  Do you have enough information to determine the approximate
        height of the building? If yes, determine the approximate height
        of the building. If not, what additional information is needed?

    height="2.959722222222222in"}A geologist wants to determine the
    distance across the widest part of a nearby lake. The geologist
    marked off specific points around the lake so that the line
    containing $\overline{DE}$ would be parallel to the line containing
    $\overline{BC}$. The segment $BC$ is selected specifically because
    it is the widest part of the lake. The segment $DE$ is selected
    specifically because it is a short enough distance to easily
    measure. The geologist sketched the situation as shown below.

    a.  Has the geologist done enough work so far to use similar
        triangles to help measure the widest part of the lake? Explain.

    b.  The geologist has made the following measurements: $|DE| = 5$
        feet, $|AE| = 7$ feet, and $|EC| = 15$ feet. Does she have
        enough information to complete the task? If so, determine the
        length across the widest part of the lake. If not, state what
        additional information is needed.

    c.  Assume the geologist could only measure a maximum distance of
        $12$ feet. Could she still find the distance across the widest
        part of the lake? What would need to be done differently?

3.  A tree is planted in the backyard of a house with the hope that one
    day it is tall enough to provide shade to cool the house. A sketch
    of the house, tree, and sun is shown below.

    height="1.7290343394575678in"}

    a.  What information is needed to determine how tall the tree must
        be to provide the desired shade?

    b.  Assume that the sun casts a shadow $32$ feet long from a point
        on top of the house to a point in front of the house. The
        distance from the end of the house's shadow to the base of the
        tree is $53$ feet. If the house is $16$ feet tall, how tall must
        the tree get to provide shade for the house?

    c.  Assume that the tree grows at a rate of $2.5$ feet per year. If
        the tree is now $7$ feet tall, about how many years will it take
        for the tree to reach the desired height?

Problem Set

1.  The world's tallest living tree is a redwood in California. It's
    about $370$ feet tall. In a local park, there is a very tall tree.
    You want to find out if the tree in the local park is anywhere near
    the height of the famous redwood.

    a.  Describe the triangles in the diagram, and explain how you know
        they are similar or not.

    b.  Assume $\bigtriangleup ESO\sim \bigtriangleup DRO$. A friend
        stands in the shadow of the tree. He is exactly $5.5$ feet tall
        and casts a shadow of $12$ feet. Is there enough information to
        determine the height of the tree? If so, determine the height.
        If not, state what additional information is needed.

    c.  Your friend stands exactly $477$ feet from the base of the tree.
        Given this new information, determine about how many feet taller
        the world's tallest tree is compared to the one in the local
        park.

    d.  Assume that your friend stands in the shadow of the world's
        tallest redwood, and the length of his shadow is just $8$ feet
        long. How long is the shadow cast by the tree?

4.  A reasonable skateboard ramp makes a $25Ëš$ angle with the ground. A
    two-foot-tall ramp requires about $4.3$ feet of wood along the base
    and about $4.7$ feet of wood from the ground to the top of the
    two-foot height to make the ramp.

    a.  Sketch a diagram to represent the situation.

    b.  Your friend is a daredevil and has decided to build a ramp that
        is $5$ feet tall. What length of wood is needed to make the base
        of the ramp? Explain your answer using properties of similar
        triangles.

    c.  What length of wood is required to go from the ground to the top
        of the $5$-foot height to make the ramp? Explain your answer
        using properties of similar triangles.
