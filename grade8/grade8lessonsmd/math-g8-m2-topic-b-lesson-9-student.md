Rotate $\bigtriangleup ABC$ $d$ degrees around center $D$. Label the
rotated image as $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$.

Rotate $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ $d\ $degrees around center $E.$ Label the
rotated image as $\bigtriangleup A''B''C''$.

Measure and label the angles and side lengths of $\bigtriangleup ABC$.
How do they compare with the images $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ and
$\bigtriangleup A''B''C''$?

How can you explain what you observed in part (c)? What statement can
you make about properties of sequences of rotations as they relate to a
single rotation?

Rotate $\bigtriangleup ABC$ $d\ $degrees around center $D,\ $and then
rotate again $d\ $degrees around center $E$. Label the image as
$\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ after you have completed both rotations.

Can a single rotation around center $D$ map $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ onto
$\bigtriangleup ABC$?

Can a single rotation around center $E\ $map $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$
onto $\bigtriangleup ABC$?

Can you find a center that would map $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ onto
$\bigtriangleup ABC$ in one rotation? If so, label the center $F$.

Rotate $\bigtriangleup ABC\ 90{^\circ}\ $(counterclockwise) around
center $D$, and then rotate the image another $90{^\circ}$
(counterclockwise) around center$\ E$. Label the image
$\bigtriangleup A'B'C'.$

Rotate $\bigtriangleup ABC\ 90{^\circ}\ $(counterclockwise) around
center $E$, and then rotate the image another $90{^\circ}$
(counterclockwise) around center $D$. Label the image
$\bigtriangleup A''B''C''.$

What do you notice about the locations of $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'\ $and
$\bigtriangleup A''B''C''$? Does the order in which you rotate a figure
around different centers have an impact on the final location of the
figure's image?

Rotate $\bigtriangleup ABC\ 90{^\circ}$ (counterclockwise) around center
$D$, and then rotate the image another $45{^\circ}$ (counterclockwise)
around center $D$. Label the image $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'.$

Rotate $\bigtriangleup ABC\ 45{^\circ}$ (counterclockwise) around center
$D$, and then rotate the image another $90{^\circ}$ (counterclockwise)
around center $D$. Label the image $\bigtriangleup A''B''C''$.

What do you notice about the locations of $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'\ $and
$\bigtriangleup A''B''C''$? Does the order in which you rotate a figure
around the same center have an impact on the final location of the
figure's image?

$\bigtriangleup ABC$ has been rotated around two different centers, and
its image is$\  \bigtriangleup A'B'C'.$ Describe a sequence of rigid
motions that would map $\bigtriangleup ABC$ onto
$\bigtriangleup A'B'C'.$

Lesson Summary

- Sequences of rotations have the same properties as a single rotation:

  - A sequence of rotations preserves degrees of measures of angles.

  - A sequence of rotations preserves lengths of segments.

- The order in which a sequence of rotations around different centers is
  performed matters with respect to the final location of the image of
  the figure that is rotated.

- The order in which a sequence of rotations around the same center is
  performed does not matter. The image of the figure will be in the same
  location.

Problem Set
