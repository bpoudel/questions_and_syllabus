Lesson 7: Informal Proofs of Properties of Dilation

Classwork

Exercise

Use the diagram below to prove the theorem: *Dilations preserve the
measures of angles.*

Let there be a dilation from center $O$ with scale factor $r$. Given
$\angle PQR$, show that since $P' = Dilation(P)$,
$Q' = Dilation(Q)$, and $R' = Dilation(R)$, then
$|\angle PQR| = |\angle P'Q'R'|$. That is, show that the image of the
angle after a dilation has the same measure, in degrees, as the
original.

Problem Set

1.  A dilation from center $O$ by scale factor $r$ of a line maps to
    what? Verify your claim on the coordinate plane.

<!-- -->

1.  A dilation from center $O$ by scale factor $r$ of a segment maps to
    what? Verify your claim on the coordinate plane.

2.  A dilation from center $O$ by scale factor $r$ of a ray maps to
    what? Verify your claim on the coordinate plane.

3.  [Challenge Problem]{.underline}:

    Prove the theorem: *A dilation maps lines to lines.*

    Let there be a dilation from center $O$ with scale factor $r$ so
    that $P' = Dilation(P)$ and $Q' = Dilation(Q)$. Show that line $PQ$
    maps to line $P'Q'$ (i.e., that dilations map lines to lines). Draw
    a diagram, and then write your informal proof of the theorem. (Hint:
    This proof is a lot like the proof for segments. This time, let $U$
    be a point on line $PQ$ that is not between points $P$ and $Q$.)
