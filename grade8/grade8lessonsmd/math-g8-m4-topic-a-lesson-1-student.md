Lesson 1: Writing Equations Using Symbols

Classwork

Exercises

Write each of the following statements using symbolic language.

The sum of four consecutive even integers is $- 28$.

A number is four times larger than the square of half the number.

Steven has some money. If he spends $\$ 9.00$, then he will have
$\frac{3}{5}$ of the amount he started with.

The sum of a number squared and three less than twice the number is
$129$.

Miriam read a book with an unknown number of pages. The first week, she
read five less than $\frac{1}{3}$ of the pages. The second week, she
read$\ 171\ $more pages and finished the book. Write an equation that
represents the total number of pages in the book.

Lesson Summary

Begin all word problems by defining your variables. State clearly what
you want each symbol to represent.

Written mathematical statements can be represented as more than one
correct symbolic statement.

Break complicated problems into smaller parts, or try working them with
simpler numbers.

Problem Set

Write each of the following statements using symbolic language.

Bruce bought two books. One book costs $\$ 4.00$ more than three times
the other. Together, the two books cost him $\$ 72$.

Janet is three years older than her sister Julie. Janet's brother is
eight years younger than their sister Julie. The sum of all of their
ages is $55\ $years.

The sum of three consecutive integers is $1,623$.

One number is six more than another number. The sum of their squares
is$\ 90$.

When you add $18$ to $\frac{1}{4}$ of a number, you get the number
itself.

When a fraction of $17$ is taken away from $17$, what remains exceeds
one-third of seventeen by six.

The sum of two consecutive even integers divided by four is $189.5$.

Subtract seven more than twice a number from the square of one-third of
the number to get zero.

The sum of three consecutive integers is $42$. Let $x$ be the middle of
the three integers. Transcribe the statement accordingly.
