Classwork

Exercises

Solve each of the following equations for $x$.

1.  $7x - 3 = 5x + 5$

2.  $7x - 3 = 7x + 5$

3.  $7x - 3 = - 3 + 7x$

Give a brief explanation as to what kind of solution(s) you expect the
following linear equations to have. Transform the equations into a
simpler form if necessary.

4.  $11x - 2x + 15 = 8 + 7 + 9x$

5.  $3(x - 14) + 1 = - 4x + 5$

6.  $- 3x + 32 - 7x = - 2(5x + 10)$

7.  $\frac{1}{2}(8x + 26) = 13 + 4x$

8.  Write two equations that have no solutions.

9.  Write two equations that have one unique solution each.

10. Write two equations that have infinitely many solutions.

Lesson Summary

There are three classifications of solutions to linear equations: one
solution (unique solution), no solution, or infinitely many solutions.

Equations with no solution will, after being simplified, have
coefficients of $x$ that are the same on both sides of the equal sign
and constants that are different. For example, $x + b = x + c$, where
$b$ and$\ c$ are constants that are not equal. A numeric example is
$8x + 5 = 8x - 3$.

Equations with infinitely many solutions will, after being simplified,
have coefficients of $x$ and constants that are the same on both sides
of the equal sign. For example, $x + a = x + a$, where $a$ is a
constant. A numeric example is $6x + 1 = 1 + 6x.$
