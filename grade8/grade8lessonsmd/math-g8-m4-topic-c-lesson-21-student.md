A line goes through the point $(8,\ 3)$ and has slope $m = 4$. Write the
equation that represents the line.

Lesson Summary

Let $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $\left( x_{2},y_{2} \right)$ be the coordinates
of two distinct points on a non-vertical line in a coordinate plane. We
find the slope of the line by

$$m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}.$$
This version of the slope formula, using coordinates of $x$ and $y$
instead of $p$ and $r$, is a commonly accepted version.

As soon as you multiply the slope by the denominator of the fraction
above, you get the following equation:

$$m\left( x_{2} - x_{1} \right) = y_{2} - y_{1}.$$

This form of an equation is referred to as the *point-slope form* of a
linear equation.

Given a known$\ (x,\ y)$, then the equation is written as

$$m\left( x - x_{1} \right) = \left( y - y_{1} \right).$$

The following is slope-intercept form of a line:

$$y = mx + b.$$

In this equation, $m$ is slope, and $(0,\ b)$ is the $y$-intercept
point.

To write the equation of a line, you must have two points, one point and
slope, or a graph of the line.
