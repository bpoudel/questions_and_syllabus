Lesson Summary

Square roots of some non-perfect squares can be simplified by using the
factors of the number. Any perfect square factors of a number can be
simplified.

For example:

$${\sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2}
}{= \sqrt{36} \times \sqrt{2}
}{= \sqrt{6^{2}} \times \sqrt{2}
}{= 6 \times \sqrt{2}
}{= 6\sqrt{2}}$$
