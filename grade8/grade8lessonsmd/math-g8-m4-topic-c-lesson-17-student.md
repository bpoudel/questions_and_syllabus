Lesson Summary

The line joining two distinct points of the graph of the linear equation
$y = mx + b$ has slope $m.$

The $m$ of $y = mx + b$ is the number that describes the slope. For
example, in the equation $y = - 2x + 4$, the slope of the graph of the
line is $- 2$.

Based on your transformed equation, what is the slope of the linear
equation $- 4x + 8y = 24$?
