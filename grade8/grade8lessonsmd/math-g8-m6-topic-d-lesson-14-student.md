Classwork

**Example 1**

Suppose a random group of people are surveyed about their use of
smartphones. The results of the survey are summarized in the tables
below.

**Example 2**

Suppose a sample of $400$ participants (teachers and students) was
randomly selected from the middle schools and high schools in a large
city. These participants responded to the following question:

Which type of movie do you prefer to watch?

Action (*The Avengers*, *Man of Steel*, etc.)

Drama (*42 (The Jackie Robinson Story*), *The Great Gatsby*, etc.)

Science Fiction (*Star Trek into Darkness*, *World War Z*, etc.)

Comedy (*Monsters University*, *Despicable Me 2*, etc.)

Movie preference and status (teacher or student) were recorded for each
participant.

Exercises 1--7

Two variables were recorded. Are these variables categorical or
numerical?

The results of the survey are summarized in the table below.

+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
|             | **Movie Preference**                                                  |           |

What proportion of participants who are teachers prefer action movies?

What proportion of participants who are teachers prefer drama movies?

What proportion of participants who are teachers prefer science fiction
movies?

What proportion of participants who are teachers prefer comedy movies?

The answers to Exercise 2 are called *row relative frequencies*. Notice
that you divided each cell frequency in the Teacher row by the total for
that row. Below is a blank relative frequency table.

Write your answers from Exercise 2 in the indicated cells in the table
above.

Find the row relative frequencies for the Student row. Write your
answers in the table above.

What proportion of participants who are students prefer action movies?

What proportion of participants who are students prefer drama movies?

What proportion of participants who are students prefer science fiction
movies?

What proportion of participants who are students prefer comedy movies?

Is a participant's status (i.e., teacher or student) related to what
type of movie he would prefer to watch? Why or why not? Discuss this
with your group.

What does it mean when we say that there is *no association* between two
variables? Discuss this with your group.

Notice that the row relative frequencies for each movie type are the
same for both the Teacher and Student rows. When this happens, we say
that the two variables, movie preference and status (student or
teacher), are *not* associated. Another way of thinking about this is to
say that knowing if a participant is a teacher (or a student) provides
no information about his movie preference.

What does it mean if row relative frequencies are not the same for all
rows of a two-way table?

You can also evaluate whether two variables are associated by looking at
column relative frequencies instead of row relative frequencies. A
column relative frequency is a cell frequency divided by the
corresponding column total. For example, the column relative frequency
for the Student/Action cell is $\frac{120}{160} = 0.75$.

Calculate the other column relative frequencies, and write them in the
table below.

| **Table of Column Relative Frequencies**                                                          |

What do you notice about the column relative frequencies for the four
columns?

What would you conclude about association based on the column relative
frequencies?

**Example 3**

In the survey described in Example 2, gender for each of the $400$
participants was also recorded. Some results of the survey are given
below:

- $160$ participants preferred action movies.

- $80$ participants preferred drama movies.

- $40$ participants preferred science fiction movies.

- $240$ participants were females.

- $78$ female participants preferred drama movies.

- $32$ male participants preferred science fiction movies.

- $60$ female participants preferred action movies.

Exercises 8--15

Use the results from Example 3 to answer the following questions. Be
sure to discuss these questions with your group members.

Complete the two-way frequency table that summarizes the data on movie
preference and gender.

What proportion of the participants are female?

If there was no association between gender and movie preference, should
you expect more females than males or fewer females than males to prefer
action movies? Explain.

Make a table of row relative frequencies of each movie type for the Male
row and the Female row. Refer to Exercises 2--4 to review how to
complete the table below.

Suppose that you randomly pick $1$ of the $400$ participants. Use the
table of row relative frequencies on the previous page to answer the
following questions.

If you had to predict what type of movie this person chose, what would
you predict? Explain why you made this choice.

If you know that the randomly selected participant is female, would you
predict that her favorite type of movie is action? If not, what would
you predict, and why?

If knowing the value of one of the variables provides information about
the value of the other variable, then there is an association between
the two variables.

Is there an association between the variables gender and movie
preference? Explain.

What can be said when two variables are associated? Read the following
sentences. Decide if each sentence is a correct statement based upon the
survey data. If it is not correct, explain why not.

More females than males participated in the survey.

Males tend to prefer action and science fiction movies.

Being female causes one to prefer drama movies.

Lesson Summary

- Saying that two variables *are not* associated means that knowing the
  value of one variable provides no information about the value of the
  other variable.

- Saying that two variables *are* associated means that knowing the
  value of one variable provides information about the value of the
  other variable.

- To determine if two variables are associated, calculate row relative
  frequencies. If the row relative frequencies are about the same for
  all of the rows, it is reasonable to say that there is no association
  between the two variables that define the table.

- Another way to decide if there is an association between two
  categorical variables is to calculate column relative frequencies. If
  the column relative frequencies are about the same for all of the
  columns, it is reasonable to say that there is no association between
  the two variables that define the table.

- If the row relative frequencies are quite different for some of the
  rows, it is reasonable to say that there is an association between the
  two variables that define the table.

Problem Set

A sample of $200$ middle school students was randomly selected from the
middle schools in a large city. Answers to several survey questions were
recorded for each student. The tables below summarize the results of the
survey.

For each table, calculate the row relative frequencies for the Female
row and for the Male row. Write the row relative frequencies beside the
corresponding frequencies in each table below.
