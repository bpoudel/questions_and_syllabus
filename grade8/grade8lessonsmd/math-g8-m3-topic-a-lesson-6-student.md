Lesson Summary

Dilation has a multiplicative effect on the coordinates of a point in
the plane. Given a point $(x,\ y)$ in the plane, a dilation from the
origin with scale factor $r$ moves the point $(x,\ y)$ to $(rx,\ ry)$.

For example, if a point $(3,\  - 5)$ in the plane is dilated from the
origin by a scale factor of $r = 4$, then the coordinates of the dilated
point are $\left( 4 \cdot 3,\ 4 \cdot ( - 5) \right) = (12,\  - 20)$.
