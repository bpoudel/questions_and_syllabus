away. It took him $25$ minutes to get to school.

    walking at the given constant speed. Write a fraction that
    represents the constant speed,$\ C$, in terms of $y$.

    solve to find how many miles Wesley walked after $15$ minutes.

d.  Let $y$ be the distance in miles that Wesley traveled after $x$
    minutes. Write a linear equation in two variables that represents
    how many miles Wesley walked after $x$ minutes.

Lesson Summary

Average speed is found by taking the total distance traveled in a given
time interval, divided by the time interval.

If $y$ is the total distance traveled in a given time interval $x$, then
$\frac{y}{x}$ is the average speed.

If we assume the same average speed over any time interval, then we have
constant speed, which can then be used to express a linear equation in
two variables relating distance and time.

If $\frac{y}{x} = C$, where $C$ is a constant, then you have constant
speed.

Problem Set

Eman walks from the store to her friend's house, $2$ miles away. It
takes her $35$ minutes.

i.  What fraction represents her constant speed, $C$?

j.  Write the fraction that represents her constant speed, $C$, if she
    walks $y$ miles in $10\ $minutes.

    walk over any time interval.

    takes her $7$ minutes.

m.  What fraction represents her constant speed, $C$?

n.  What fraction represents her constant speed, $C$, if it takes her
    $x$ minutes to drive exactly $1\ $mile?

o.  Write and solve a proportion using the fractions from parts (a)
    and (b) to determine how much time it takes her to drive exactly $1$
    mile. Round your answer to the tenths place.

    two-variable equation to represent the number of miles Darla can
    drive in $x$ hours.

r.  Darla plans to drive to the market $14$ miles from her house, then
    to the post office $3$ miles from the market, and then return home,
    which is $15$ miles from the post office. Assuming she drives at a
    constant speed the entire time, how long will it take her to run her
    errands and get back home? Round your answer to the hundredths
    place.
