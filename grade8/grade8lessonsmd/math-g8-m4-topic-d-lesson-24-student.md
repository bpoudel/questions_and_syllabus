Exercises

Derek scored $30$ points in the basketball game he played, and not once
did he go to the free throw line. That means that Derek scored two-point
shots and three-point shots. List as many combinations of two- and
three-pointers as you can that would total $30$ points.

  Number of Two-Pointers              Number of Three-Pointers

Write an equation to describe the data.

Derek tells you that the number of two-point shots that he made is five
more than the number of three-point shots. How many combinations can you
come up with that fit this scenario? (Don't worry about the total number
of points.)

Write an equation to describe the data.

Which pair of numbers from your table in Exercise 2 would show Derek's
actual score of $30$ points?

Efrain and Fernie are on a road trip. Each of them drives at a constant
speed. Efrain is a safe driver and travels $45$ miles per hour for the
entire trip. Fernie is not such a safe driver. He drives $70$ miles per
hour throughout the trip. Fernie and Efrain left from the same location,
but Efrain left at 8:00$\ $a.m., and Fernie left at 11:00$\ $a.m.
Assuming they take the same route, will Fernie ever catch up to Efrain?
If so, approximately when?

a.  Write the linear equation that represents Efrain's constant speed.
    Make sure to include in your equation the extra time that Efrain was
    able to travel.

b.  Write the linear equation that represents Fernie's constant speed.

c.  Write the system of linear equations that represents this situation.

d.  Sketch the graphs of the two linear equations.

    Jessica and Karl run at constant speeds. Jessica can run $3$ miles
    in $24$ minutes. Karl can run $2$ miles in $14$ minutes. They decide
    to race each other. As soon as the race begins, Karl trips and takes
    $2$ minutes to recover.

    Make sure to include in your equation the extra time that Jessica
    was able to run.

h.  Write the linear equation that represents Karl's constant speed.

k.  Use the graph to answer the questions below.

    If Jessica and Karl raced for $3$ miles, who would win? Explain.

    At approximately what point would Jessica and Karl be tied? Explain.

Lesson Summary

A *system of linear equations* is a set of two or more linear equations.
When graphing a pair of linear equations in two variables, both
equations in the system are graphed on the same coordinate plane.

A *solution to a system of two linear equations in two variables* is an
ordered pair of numbers that is a solution to both equations. For
example, the solution to the system of linear equations
$\left\{ \begin{array}{r}
x + y = 6 \\
x - y = 4
\end{array} \right.\ $ is the ordered pair $(5,\ 1)$ because
substituting $5$ in for $x$ and $1$ in for $y$ results in two true
equations: $5 + 1 = 6$ and $5 - 1 = 4$.

Systems of linear equations are notated using brackets to group the
equations, for example: $\left\{ \begin{array}{r}
y = \frac{1}{8}x + \frac{5}{2} \\
y = \frac{4}{25}x\ \ \ \ \ \ 
\end{array} \right.\ .$

Problem Set

Jeremy and Gerardo run at constant speeds. Jeremy can run $1$ mile in
$8$ minutes, and Gerardo can run $3$ miles in $33$ minutes. Jeremy
started running $10$ minutes after Gerardo. Assuming they run the same
path, when will Jeremy catch up to Gerardo?

l.  Write the linear equation that represents Jeremy's constant speed.

m.  Write the linear equation that represents Gerardo's constant speed.
    Make sure to include in your equation the extra time that Gerardo
    was able to run.

n.  Write the system of linear equations that represents this situation.

o.  Sketch the graphs of the two equations.

p.  Will Jeremy ever catch up to Gerardo? If so, approximately when?

q.  At approximately what point do the graphs of the lines intersect?

    Two cars drive from town A to town B at constant speeds. The blue
    car travels $25$ miles per hour, and the red car travels $60$ miles
    per hour. The blue car leaves at 9:30$\ $a.m., and the red car
    leaves at noon. The distance between the two towns is $150$ miles.

r.  Who will get there first? Write and graph the system of linear
    equations that represents this situation.
