Lesson Summary

To determine the distance between two points on the coordinate plane,
begin by connecting the two points. Then, draw a vertical line through
one of the points and a horizontal line through the other point. The
intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines forms a right triangle
to which the Pythagorean theorem can be applied.

To verify if a triangle is a right triangle, use the converse of the
Pythagorean theorem.
