**Example 1**

Consider the fraction $\frac{5}{8}$. Write an equivalent form of this
fraction with a denominator that is a power of $10$, and hence write the
decimal expansion of this fraction.

        your answer is reasonable.

6.  Convert the fraction $\frac{3}{250}$ to a decimal.

7.  Convert the fraction $\frac{7}{1250}$ to a decimal.

Lesson Summary

Fractions with denominators that can be expressed as products of $2$'s
and/or $5$'s are equivalent to fractions with denominators that are a
power of $10$. These are precisely the fractions with finite decimal
expansions.

Example:

Does the fraction $\frac{1}{8}$ have a finite or an infinite decimal
expansion?

Since $8 = 2^{3}$, then the fraction has a finite decimal expansion. The
decimal expansion is found as

$$\frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2^{3}} = \frac{1 \times 5^{3}}{2^{3} \times 5^{3}} = \frac{125}{10^{3}} = 0.125.$$

If the denominator of a (simplified) fraction cannot be expressed as a
product of $2$'s and/or $5$'s, then the decimal expansion of the number
will be infinite.

Problem Set

Convert each fraction given to a finite decimal, if possible. If the
fraction cannot be written as a finite decimal, then state how you know.
You may use a calculator, but show your steps for each problem.
