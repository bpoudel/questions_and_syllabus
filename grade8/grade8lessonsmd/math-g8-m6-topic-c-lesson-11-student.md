Lesson 11: Using Linear Models in a Data Context

Classwork

**Exercises**

Old Faithful is a geyser in Yellowstone National Park. The following
table offers some rough estimates of the length of an eruption (in
minutes) and the amount of water (in gallons) in that eruption.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Length (minutes)**          $$1.5$$     $$2$$       $$3$$       $$4.5$$
  ----------------------------- ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------
  **Amount of Water (gallons)** $$3,700$$   $$4,100$$   $$6,450$$   $$8,400$$

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This data is consistent with actual eruption and summary statistics that
can be found at the following links:

<http://geysertimes.org/geyser.php?id=OldFaithful> and
<http://www.yellowstonepark.com/2011/07/about-old-faithful/>

Chang wants to predict the amount of water in an eruption based on the
length of the eruption. What should he use as the dependent variable?
Why?

Which of the following two scatter plots should Chang use to build his
prediction model? Explain.

Suppose that Chang believes the variables to be linearly related. Use
the *first* and *last* data points in the table to create a linear
prediction model.

A friend of Chang's told him that Old Faithful produces about $3,000$
gallons of water for every minute that it erupts. Does the linear model
from part (c) support what Chang's friend said? Explain.

Using the linear model from part (c), does it make sense to interpret
the $y$-intercept$\ $in the context of this problem? Explain.

The following table gives the times of the gold, silver, and bronze
medal winners for the men's $100$-meter race\
(in seconds) for the past $10$ Olympic Games.

  ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------- ---------- ----------- ---------- ----------- ----------- -----------
     Gold     $$9.63$$   $$9.69$$   $$9.85$$   $$9.87$$    $$9.84$$   $$9.96$$    $$9.92$$   $$9.99$$    $$10.25$$   $$10.06$$

Data Source:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres_at_the_Olympics#Men>

If you wanted to describe how mean times change over the years, which
variable would you use as the independent variable, and which would you
use as the dependent variable?

Draw a scatter plot to determine if the relationship between mean time
and year appears to be linear. Comment on any trend or pattern that you
see in the scatter plot.

One reasonable line goes through the 1992 and 2004 data. Find the
equation of that line.

Before he saw these data, Chang guessed that the mean time of the three
Olympic medal winners decreased by about $0.05$ seconds from one Olympic
Game to the next. Does the prediction model you found in part (c)
support his guess? Explain.

If the trend continues, what mean race time would you predict for the
gold, silver, and bronze medal winners in the 2016 Olympic Games?
Explain how you got this prediction.

The data point $(1980,\ 10.3)$ appears to have an unusually high value
for the mean race time $(10.3).$ Using your library or the Internet, see
if you can find a possible explanation for why that might have happened.

Lesson Summary

In the real world, it is rare that two numerical variables are exactly
linearly related. If the data are roughly linearly related, then a line
can be drawn through the data. This line can then be used to make
predictions and to answer questions. For now, the line is informally
drawn, but in later grades more formal methods for determining a
best-fitting line are presented.

Problem Set

From the United States Bureau of Census website, the population sizes
(in millions of people) in the United States for census years 1790--2010
are as follows.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     **Year**       1790       1800       1810        1820        1830        1840        1850        1860        1870        1880        1890     
  -------------- ---------- ---------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------
   **Population   $$3.9$$    $$5.3$$     $$7.2$$     $$9.6$$    $$12.9$$    $$17.1$$    $$23.2$$    $$31.4$$    $$38.6$$    $$50.2$$    $$63.0$$   
      Size**                                                                                                                                       

                                                                                                                                                   

     **Year**       1900       1910       1920        1930        1940        1950        1960        1970        1980        1990        2000        2010

   **Population   $$76.2$$   $$92.2$$   $$106.0$$   $$123.2$$   $$132.2$$   $$151.3$$   $$179.3$$   $$203.3$$   $$226.5$$   $$248.7$$   $$281.4$$   $$308.7$$
      Size**                                                                                                                                       
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wanted to be able to predict population size in a given year,
which variable would be the independent variable, and which would be the
dependent variable?

Draw a scatter plot. Does the relationship between year and population
size appear to be linear?

Consider the data only from 1950 to 2010. Does the relationship between
year and population size for these years appear to be linear?

One line that could be used to model the relationship between year and
population size for the data from 1950 to 2010 is
$y = - 4875.021 + 2.578x$. Suppose that a sociologist believes that
there will be negative consequences if population size in the United
States increases by more than$\ 2\frac{3}{4}$ million people annually.
Should she be concerned? Explain your reasoning.

Assuming that the linear pattern continues, use the line given in part
(d) to predict the size of the population in the United States in the
next census.

In search of a topic for his science class project, Bill saw an
interesting YouTube video in which dropping mint candies into bottles of
a soda pop caused the soda pop to spurt immediately from the bottle. He
wondered if the height of the spurt was linearly related to the number
of mint candies that were used. He collected data using $1,$ $3,\ 5$,
and $10\ $mint candies. Then, he used two-liter bottles of a diet soda
and measured the height of the spurt in centimeters. He tried each
quantity of mint candies three times. His data are in the following
table.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Number of Mint    $$1$$    $$1$$    $$1$$    $$3$$     $$3$$     $$3$$    $$5$$     $$5$$     $$5$$     $$10$$    $$10$$    $$10$$
  Candies**                                                                                                                     
  ------------------- -------- -------- -------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  **Height of Spurt   $$40$$   $$35$$   $$30$$   $$110$$   $$105$$   $$90$$   $$170$$   $$160$$   $$180$$   $$400$$   $$390$$   $$420$$
  (centimeters)**                                                                                                               

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identify which variable is the independent variable and which is the
dependent variable.

Draw a scatter plot that could be used to determine whether the
relationship between height of spurt and number of mint candies appears
to be linear.

Bill sees a slight curvature in the scatter plot, but he thinks that the
relationship between the number of mint candies and the height of the
spurt appears close enough to being linear, and he proceeds to draw a
line. His eyeballed line goes through the mean of the three heights for
three mint candies and the mean of the three heights for $10$ candies.
Bill calculates the equation of his eyeballed line to be

$y = - 27.617 + (43.095)x$,

where the height of the spurt ($y$) in centimeters is based on the
number of mint candies ($x$). Do you agree with this calculation? He
rounded all of his calculations to three decimal places. Show your work.

In the context of this problem, interpret in words the slope and
intercept for Bill's line. Does interpreting the intercept make sense in
this context? Explain.

If the linear trend continues for greater numbers of mint candies, what
do you predict the height of the spurt to be if $15$ mint candies are
used?
