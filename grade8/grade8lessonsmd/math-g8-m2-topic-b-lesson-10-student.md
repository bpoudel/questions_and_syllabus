Exercises

In the following picture, triangle $ABC$ can be traced onto a
transparency and mapped onto triangle $A'B'C'$.

Which basic rigid motion, or sequence of, would map one triangle onto
the other?

In the following picture, we have two pairs of triangles. In each pair,
triangle $ABC$ can be traced onto a transparency and mapped onto
triangle $A'B'C'$.

Let two figures $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$ be given so that the length of curved
segment $AC$ equals the length of curved segment $A'C'$,
$|\angle B| = \left| \angle B' \right| = 80{^\circ}$, and
$|AB| = \left| A'B' \right| = 5$. With clarity and precision, describe a
sequence of rigid motions that would map figure $ABC$ onto figure
$A'B'C'$*.*

Problem Set

Let there be the translation along vector $\overrightarrow{v}$, let
there be the rotation around point $A$*,* $- 90$ degrees (clockwise),
and let there be the reflection across line $L$. Let $S$ be the figure
as shown below. Show the location of $S$ after performing the following
sequence: a translation followed by a rotation followed by a reflection.

Would the location of the image of $S$ in the previous problem be the
same if the translation was performed last instead of first; that is,
does the sequence, translation followed by a rotation followed by a
reflection, equal a rotation followed by a reflection followed by a
translation? Explain.

Use the same coordinate grid to complete parts (a)--(c).

Reflect triangle $ABC$ across the vertical line, parallel to the
$y$-axis, going through point $(1,\ 0)$. Label the transformed points
$A$, $B$, $C$ as $A'$,$\ B'$,$\ C'$, respectively.

Reflect triangle $A'B'C'$ across the horizontal line, parallel to the
$x$-axis going through point $(0,\  - 1)$. Label the transformed points
of $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ as $A^{''}$, $B^{''}$, $C''$, respectively.

Is there a single rigid motion that would map triangle $ABC$ to triangle
$A^{''}B^{''}C^{''}$?
