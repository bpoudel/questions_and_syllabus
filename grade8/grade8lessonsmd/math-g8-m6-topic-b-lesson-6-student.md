Lesson 6: Scatter Plots

Classwork

**Example 1**

A bivariate data set consists of observations on two variables. For
example, you might collect data on $13$ different car models. Each
observation in the data set would consist of an $(x,\ y)$ pair.

$x$: weight (in pounds, rounded to the nearest $50$ pounds)

and

$y$: fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon, mpg)

The table below shows the weight and fuel efficiency for $13$ car models
with automatic transmissions manufactured in 2009 by Chevrolet.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         **Model**          **Weight (pounds)**      **Fuel Efficiency
                                                          (mpg)**

          $$12$$                 $$4,500$$                $$16$$

          $$13$$                 $$4,800$$                $$15$$

Exercises 1--8

In the Example 1 table, the observation corresponding to Model 1 is
($3200,\ 23$). What is the fuel efficiency of this car? What is the
weight of this car?

observations to the scatter plot.

Do you notice a pattern in the scatter plot? What does this imply about
the relationship between weight ($x$) and fuel efficiency ($y$)?

Is there a relationship between price and the quality of athletic shoes?
The data in the table below are from the *Consumer Reports* website.

$x$: price (in dollars)

and

$y$: *Consumer Reports* quality rating

The quality rating is on a scale of $0$ to $100$, with $100$ being the
highest quality.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         **Shoe**           **Price (dollars)**     **Quality Rating**
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
           $$1$$                  $$65$$                  $$71$$

           $$2$$                  $$45$$                  $$70$$

           $$3$$                  $$45$$                  $$62$$

           $$4$$                  $$80$$                  $$59$$

           $$5$$                  $$110$$                 $$58$$

           $$6$$                  $$110$$                 $$57$$

           $$7$$                  $$30$$                  $$56$$

           $$8$$                  $$80$$                  $$52$$

           $$9$$                  $$110$$                 $$51$$

          $$10$$                  $$70$$                  $$51$$
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

One observation in the data set is$\ (110,\ 57)$. What does this ordered
pair represent in terms of cost and quality?

To construct a scatter plot of these data, you need to start by thinking
about appropriate scales for the axes of the scatter plot. The prices in
the data set range from$\ \$ 30$ to $\$ 110$, so one reasonable choice
for the scale of the $x$-axis would range from$\ \$ 20\ $to $\$ 120$, as
shown below. What would be a reasonable choice for a scale for the
$y$-axis?

Add a scale to the $y$-axis. Then, use these axes to construct a scatter
plot of the data.

Do you see any pattern in the scatter plot indicating that there is a
relationship between price and quality rating for athletic shoes?

Some people think that if shoes have a high price, they must be of high
quality. How would you respond?

**Example 2: Statistical Relationships**

A pattern in a scatter plot indicates that the values of one variable
tend to vary in a predictable way as the values of the other variable
change. This is called a *statistical relationship*. In the fuel
efficiency and car weight example, fuel efficiency tended to decrease as
car weight increased.

This is useful information, but be careful not to jump to the conclusion
that increasing the weight of a car *causes* the fuel efficiency to go
down. There may be some other explanation for this. For example, heavier
cars may also have bigger engines, and bigger engines may be less
efficient. You cannot conclude that changes to one variable *cause*
changes in the other variable just because there is a statistical
relationship in a scatter plot.

Exercises 9--10

Data were collected on

$x$:$\ $ shoe size

and

$y$: score on a reading ability test

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image3.png){width="4.4in"
height="2.921527777777778in"}for $29$ elementary school students. The
scatter plot of these data is shown below. Does there appear to be a
statistical relationship between shoe size and score on the reading
test?

Explain why it is not reasonable to conclude that having big feet causes
a high reading score. Can you think of a different explanation for why
you might see a pattern like this?

Lesson Summary

- A scatter plot is a graph of numerical data on two variables.

- A pattern in a scatter plot suggests that there may be a relationship
  between the two variables used to construct the scatter plot.

- If two variables tend to vary together in a predictable way, we can
  say that there is a statistical relationship between the two
  variables.

- A statistical relationship between two variables does not imply that a
  change in one variable causes a change in the other variable (a
  cause-and-effect relationship).

Scientists are interested in finding out how different species adapt to
finding food sources. One group studied crocodilian species to find out
how their bite force was related to body mass and diet. The table below
