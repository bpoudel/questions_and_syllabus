Exercises 1--2

Dilate ellipse $E$, from center $O$ at the origin of the graph, with
scale factor $r = 2$. Use as many points as necessary to develop the
dilated image of ellipse $E$.

What shape was the dilated image?

Exercise 3

Triangle $ABC$ has been dilated from center $O$ by a scale factor of
$r = \frac{1}{4}$ denoted by triangle $A'B'C'$. Using a centimeter
ruler, verify that it would take a scale factor of $r = 4$ from center
$O$ to map triangle $A'B'C'$ onto triangle $ABC$.

Lesson Summary

Dilations map circles to circles and ellipses to ellipses.

If a figure is dilated by scale factor $r$, we must dilate it by a scale
factor of $\frac{1}{r}$ to bring the dilated figure back to the original
size. For example, if a scale factor is $r = 4$, then to bring a dilated
figure back to the original size, we must dilate it by a scale factor
$r = \frac{1}{4}$.

Problem Set

Dilate the figure from center $O$ by a scale factor $r = 2$. Make sure
to use enough points to make a good image of the original figure.

Describe the process for selecting points when dilating a curved figure.

A figure was dilated from center $O$ by a scale factor of $r = 5$. What
scale factor would shrink the dilated figure back to the original size?

A figure has been dilated from center $O$ by a scale factor of
$r = \frac{7}{6}$. What scale factor would shrink the dilated figure
back to the original size?

A figure has been dilated from center $O$ by a scale factor of
$r = \frac{3}{10}$. What scale factor would magnify the dilated figure
back to the original size?
