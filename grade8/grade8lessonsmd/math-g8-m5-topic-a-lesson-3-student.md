Classwork

**Example 1**

In the last lesson, we looked at several tables of values showing the
inputs and outputs of functions. For instance, one table showed the
costs of purchasing different numbers of bags of candy:

**Example 4**

Water flows from a faucet into a bathtub at the constant rate of $7$
gallons of water pouring out every $2$ minutes. The bathtub is initially
empty, and its plug is in. Determine the rule that describes the volume
of water in the tub as a function of time. If the tub can hold $50$
gallons of water, how long will it take to fill the tub?

Now assume that you are filling the same $50$-gallon bathtub with water
flowing in at the constant rate of $3.5$ gallons per minute, but there
were initially $8$ gallons of water in the tub. Will it still take about
$14$ minutes to fill the tub?

**Example 5**

Water flows from a faucet at a constant rate. Assume that $\mathbf{6}$
gallons of water are already in a tub by the time we notice the faucet
is on. This information is recorded in the first column of the table
below. The other columns show how many gallons of water are in the tub
at different numbers of minutes since we noticed the running faucet.

A linear equation $y = mx + b$ describes a rule for a function. We call
any function defined by a linear equation a linear function.

Problems involving a constant rate of change or a proportional
relationship can be described by linear functions.

    following table shows the total number of cans they have distributed
