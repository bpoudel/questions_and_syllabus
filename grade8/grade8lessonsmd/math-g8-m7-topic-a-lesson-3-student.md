Lesson 3: Existence and Uniqueness of Square Roots and Cube Roots

Classwork

Opening

The numbers in each column are related. Your goal is to determine how
they are related, determine which numbers belong in the blank parts of
the columns, and write an explanation for how you know the numbers
belong there.

Lesson Summary

The symbol $\sqrt[n]{}$ is called a *radical*. An equation that contains
that symbol is referred to as a *radical equation*. So far, we have only
worked with square roots (i.e., $n = 2$). Technically, we would denote a
positive square root as $\sqrt[2]{}$, but it is understood that the
symbol $\sqrt{}$ alone represents a positive square root.

When $n = 3$, then the symbol $\sqrt[3]{}$ is used to denote the cube
root of a number. Since $x^{3} = x \bullet x \bullet x$, the cube root
of $x^{3}$ is $x$ (i.e., $\sqrt[3]{x^{3}} = x$).

The square or cube root of a positive number exists, and there can be
only one positive square root or one cube root of the number.
