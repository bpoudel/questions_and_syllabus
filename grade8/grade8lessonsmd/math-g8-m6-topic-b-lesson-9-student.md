Lesson 9: Determining the Equation of a Line Fit to Data

Classwork

**Example 1: Crocodiles and Alligators**

Scientists are interested in finding out how different species adapt to
finding food sources. One group studied crocodilians to find out how
their bite force was related to body mass and diet. The table below
displays the information they collected on body mass (in pounds) and
bite force (in pounds).

is a good idea to begin by looking at what a scatter plot tells you
about the data. The scatter plot below displays the data on body mass
and bite force for the crocodilians in the study.

Exercises 1--6

Describe the relationship between body mass and bite force for the
crocodilians shown in the scatter plot.

Draw a line to represent the trend in the data. Comment on what you
considered in drawing your line.

Based on your line, predict the bite force for a crocodilian that weighs
$220$ pounds. How does this prediction compare to the actual bite force
of the $220$-pound crocodilian in the data set?

height="2.2956528871391075in"}Several students decided to draw lines to
represent the trend in the data. Consider the lines drawn by Sol, Patti,
Marrisa, and Taylor, which are shown below.

For each student, indicate whether or not you think the line would be a
good line to use to make predictions.\
Explain your thinking.

a.  Sol's line

b.  Patti's line

c.  Marrisa's line

d.  Taylor's line

**\**

What is the equation of your line? Show the steps you used to determine
your line. Based on your equation, what is your prediction for the bite
force of a crocodilian weighing $200$ pounds?

Patti drew vertical line segments from two points to the line in her
scatter plot. The first point she selected was for a dwarf crocodile.
The second point she selected was for an Indian gharial crocodile.

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image6.wmf){width="4.322916666666667in"
height="2.8958333333333335in"}

Would Patti's line have resulted in a predicted bite force that was
closer to the actual bite force for the dwarf crocodile or for the
Indian gharial crocodile? What aspect of the scatter plot supports your
answer?

Would it be preferable to describe the trend in a scatter plot using a
line that makes the differences in the actual and predicted values large
or small? Explain your answer.

Exercise 7: Used Cars

Suppose the plot below shows the age (in years) and price (in dollars)
of used compact cars that were advertised in a local newspaper.

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image7.wmf){width="4.625in"
height="2.8854166666666665in"}

Based on the scatter plot above, describe the relationship between the
age and price of the used cars.

![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image8.wmf){width="4.509722222222222in"
height="3.0in"}Nora drew a line she thought was close to many of the
points and found the equation of the line. She used the points
$(13,\ 6000)\ $and $(7,\ 12000)$ on her line to find the equation.
Explain why those points made finding the equation easy.

Find the equation of Nora's line for predicting the price of a used car
given its age. Summarize the trend described by this equation.

Based on the line, for which car in the data set would the predicted
value be farthest from the actual value? How can you tell?

What does the equation predict for the cost of a $10$-year-old car? How
close was the prediction using the line to the actual cost of the
$10$-year-old car in the data set? Given the context of the data set, do
you think the difference between the predicted price and the actual
price is large or small?

Is $\$ 5,000$ typical of the differences between predicted prices and
actual prices for the cars in this data set? Justify your answer.

Lesson Summary

- A line can be used to represent the trend in a scatter plot.

- Evaluating the equation of the line for a value of the independent
  variable determines a value predicted by the line.

- A good line for prediction is one that goes through the middle of the
  points in a scatter plot and for which the points tend to fall close
  to the line.

Problem Set

The Monopoly board game is popular in many countries. The scatter plot
below shows the distance from "Go" to a property (in number of spaces
moving from "Go" in a clockwise direction) and the price of the
properties on the Monopoly board. The equation of the line is
$P = 8x + 40$, where $P$ represents the price (in Monopoly dollars) and
$x$ represents the distance (in number of spaces).

"Go" in Monopoly**

Use the equation to find the difference (observed value$-$predicted
value) for the most expensive property and for the property that is $35$
spaces from "Go."

Five of the points seem to lie in a horizontal line. What do these
points have in common? What is the equation of the line containing those
five points?

Four of the five points described in part (b) are the railroads. If you
were fitting a line to predict price with distance from "Go," would you
use those four points? Why or why not?

The table below gives the coordinates of the five points shown in the
scatter plots that follow. The scatter plots show two different lines.

For which data points is the prediction based on Line 1 closer to the
actual value than the prediction based on Line 2?

Which line (Line 1 or Line 2) would you select as a better fit? Explain.

The scatter plots below show different lines that students used to model
the relationship between body mass (in pounds) and bite force (in
pounds) for crocodilians.

Match each graph to one of the equations below, and explain your
reasoning. Let $B$ represent bite force (in pounds) and $W$ represent
body mass (in pounds).

Which of the lines would best fit the trend in the data? Explain your
thinking.

Comment on the following statements:

A line modeling a trend in a scatter plot always goes through the
origin.

If the response variable increases as the independent variable
decreases, the slope of a line modeling the trend is negative.
