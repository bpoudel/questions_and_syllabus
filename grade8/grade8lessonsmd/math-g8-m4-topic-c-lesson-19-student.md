Exercises

**[Theorem]{.smallcaps}:** The graph of a linear equation $y = mx + b$
is a non-vertical line with slope $m$ and passing through $(0,\ b)$,
where $b$ is a constant.

1.  Prove the theorem by completing parts (a)--(c). Given two distinct
    points, $P$ and $Q$, on the graph of $y = mx + b$, and let $l$ be
    the line passing through $P$ and $Q.$ You must show the following:

<!-- -->

(1) Any point on the graph of $y = mx + b$ is on line $l$, and

(2) Any point on the line $l$ is on the graph of $y = mx + b.\ $

    a.  Proof of (1): Let $R$ be any point on the graph of $y = mx + b$.
        Show that $R$ is on $l$. Begin by assuming it is not. Assume the
        graph looks like the diagram below where $R$ is on $l'$.

        What is the slope of line $l$?

        What is the slope of line $l'$?

        What can you conclude about lines $l$ and $l'$? Explain.

    b.  Proof of (2): Let $S$ be any point on line $l,$ as shown.

        Show that $S$ is a solution to $y = mx + b$. Hint: Use the point
        $(0,\ b)$.

    c.  Now that you have shown that any point on the graph of
        $y = mx + b$ is on line $l$ in part (a), and any point on line
        $l$ is on the graph of $y = mx + b$ in part (b), what can you
        conclude about the graphs of linear equations?

Lesson Summary

The graph of a linear equation is a line. A linear equation can be
graphed using two-points: the $x$-intercept point and the $y$-intercept
point.

Example:

> Graph the equation: $2x + 3y = 9$.
>
> Replace $x$ with zero, and solve for $y$ to determine the
> $y$-intercept point.
>
> $${2(0) + 3y = 9
> }{3y = 9
> }{y = 3}$$
>
> The $y$-intercept point is at $(0,\ 3)$.
>
> Replace $y$ with zero, and solve for $x$ to determine the
> $x$-intercept point.
>
> $${2x + 3(0) = 9
> }{2x = 9
> }{x = \frac{9}{2}}$$
>
> The $x$-intercept point is at $(\frac{9}{2},0).$
