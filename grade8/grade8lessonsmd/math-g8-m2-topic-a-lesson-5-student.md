Problem Set

Lesson Summary

Rotations require information about the center of rotation and the
degree in which to rotate. Positive degrees of rotation move the figure
in a counterclockwise direction. Negative degrees of rotation move the
figure in a clockwise direction.

Basic Properties of Rotations:

- (Rotation 1) A rotation maps a line to a line, a ray to a ray, a
  segment to a segment, and an angle to an angle.

- (Rotation 2) A rotation preserves lengths of segments.

- (Rotation 3) A rotation preserves measures of angles.

When parallel lines are rotated, their images are also parallel. A line
is only parallel to itself when rotated exactly $180{^\circ}$.

**Terminology**

**[Rotation (description):]{.smallcaps}** For a number $d$ between $0$
and $180$, the *rotation of* $d$ *degrees around center* $O$ is the
transformation of the plane that maps the point $O$ to itself, and maps
each remaining point $P$ of the plane to its image $P'$ in the
counterclockwise half-plane of ray $\overrightarrow{OP}$ so that $P$ and
$P'$ are the same distance away from $O$ and the measurement of
$\angle P'OP$ is $d$ degrees.

The *counterclockwise half-plane* is the half-plane that lies to the
left of $\overrightarrow{OP}$ while moving along $\overrightarrow{OP}$
in the direction from $O$ to $P$.

Let there be a rotation by $- 90{^\circ}$ around the center $O$*.*

Explain why a rotation of $90$ degrees around any point $O$ never maps a
line to a line parallel to itself.

A segment of length $94\ cm$ has been rotated $d$ degrees around a
center $O$. What is the length of the rotated segment? How do you know?

An angle of size $124{^\circ}$ has been rotated $d$ degrees around a
center $O$*.* What is the size of the rotated angle? How do you know?
