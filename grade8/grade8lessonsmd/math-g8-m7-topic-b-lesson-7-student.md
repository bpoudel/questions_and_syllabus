Lesson Summary

An infinite decimal is a decimal whose expanded form is infinite.

Example:\
The expanded form of the decimal $0.8\overline{3} = 0.83333$... is
$\frac{8}{10} + \frac{3}{10^{2}} + \frac{3}{10^{3}} + \frac{3}{10^{4}} + \ldots.$

To pin down the placement of an infinite decimal on the number line, we
first identify within which tenth it lies, then within which hundredth
it lies, then within which thousandth, and so on. These intervals have
widths getting closer and closer to a width of zero.

This reasoning allows us to deduce that the infinite decimal $0.9999$...
and$\ 1\ $have the same location on the number line. Consequently,
$0.\overline{9} = 1$.
