Lesson 11: Efficacy of Scientific Notation

Classwork

Exercise 1

The mass of a proton is

> $0.000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 001\, 672\, 622\ kg$.

In scientific notation it is

Exercise 2

The mass of an electron is

> $0.000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 000\, 910\, 938\, 291\ kg$.

In scientific notation it is

Exercise 3

Write the ratio that compares the mass of a proton to the mass of an
electron.

Exercise 4

Compute how many times heavier a proton is than an electron (i.e., find
the value of the ratio). Round your final answer to the nearest one.

**Example 2**

The U.S. national debt as of March $23$, $2013$, rounded to the nearest
dollar, is $\$ 16,755,133,009,522$. According to the $2012$ U.S. census,
there are about $313,914,040$ U.S. citizens. What is each citizen's
approximate share of the debt?

$${\frac{1.6755 \times 10^{13}}{3.14 \times 10^{8}} = \frac{1.6755}{3.14} \times \frac{10^{13}}{10^{8}}
}{= \frac{1.6755}{3.14} \times 10^{5}
}{= 0.533598... \times 10^{5}
}{\approx 0.5336 \times 10^{5}
}{= 53360}$$

*Each U.S. citizen's share of the national debt is about* $\$ 53,360$*.*

Exercise 5

The geographic area of California is $163,696\ sq.\ mi.$, and the
geographic area of the U.S. is $3,794,101\ sq.\ mi.$ Let's round off
these figures to $1.637 \times 10^{5}$ and $3.794 \times 10^{6}$. In
terms of area, roughly estimate how many Californias would make up one
U.S. Then compute the answer to the nearest ones.

Exercise 6

The average distance from Earth to the moon is about
$3.84 \times 10^{5}\ km$, and the distance from Earth to Mars is
approximately $9.24 \times 10^{7}\ km$ in year $2014$. On this
simplistic level, how much farther is traveling from Earth to Mars than
from Earth to the moon?

Problem Set

There are approximately $7.5 \times 10^{18}$ grains of sand on Earth.
There are approximately $7 \times 10^{27}$ atoms in an average human
body. Are there more grains of sand on Earth or atoms in an average
human body? How do you know?

About how many times more atoms are in a human body compared to grains
of sand on Earth?

Suppose the geographic areas of California and the U.S. are
$1.637 \times 10^{5}$ and $3.794 \times 10^{6}\ sq.\ mi.$, respectively.
California's population (as of $2012$) is approximately
$3.804 \times 10^{7}$ people. If population were proportional to area,
what would be the U.S. population?

The actual population of the U.S. (as of $2012$) is approximately
$3.14 \times 10^{8}$. How does the population density of California
(i.e., the number of people per square mile) compare with the population
density of the U.S.?
