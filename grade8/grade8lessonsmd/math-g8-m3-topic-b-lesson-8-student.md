Lesson 8: Similarity

Classwork

**Example 1**

In the picture below, we have a triangle $ABC$ that has been dilated
from center $O$ by a scale factor of $r = \frac{1}{2}$. It is noted by
$A'B'C'$. We also have triangle $A''B''C''$, which is congruent to
triangle $A'B'C'$ (i.e.,
$\bigtriangleup A'B'C' \cong \bigtriangleup A''B''C''$).

Describe the sequence that would map triangle $A''B''C''$ onto triangle
$ABC$.

Exercises

Triangle $ABC$ was dilated from center $O$ by scale factor
$r = \frac{1}{2}$. The dilated triangle is noted by $A'B'C'$*.* Another
triangle $A''B''C''$ is congruent to triangle $A'B'C'$ (i.e.,
$\bigtriangleup A''B''C'' \cong \bigtriangleup A'B'C'$). Describe a
dilation followed by the basic rigid motion that would map triangle
$A''B''C''$ onto triangle $ABC$.

Lesson Summary

A *similarity transformation* (or a *similarity*) is a sequence of a
finite number of dilations or basic rigid motions. Two figures are
*similar* if there is a similarity transformation taking one figure onto
the other figure. Every similarity can be represented as a dilation
followed by a congruence.

The notation $\bigtriangleup ABC\sim \bigtriangleup A'B'C'\ $means that
$\bigtriangleup ABC$ is similar to $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$.

Problem Set

In the picture below, we have triangle $DEF$ that has been dilated from
center $O$ by scale factor $r = 4$. It is noted by $D'E'F'$*.* We also
have triangle $D''E''F''$, which is congruent to triangle $D'E'F'$
(i.e., $\bigtriangleup D'E'F' \cong \bigtriangleup D''E''F''$). Describe
the sequence of a dilation, followed by a congruence (of one or more
rigid motions ), that would map triangle $D''E''F''$ onto triangle
$DEF$.
