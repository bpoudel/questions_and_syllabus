    a.  Translate $\angle ABC$ and segment $ED\ $along vector
        $\overrightarrow{FG}.\ $ Label the translated images
        appropriately, that is, $\angle A'B'C'\ $and segment $E'D'$.

    b.  Translate $\angle A'B'C'$ and segment $E'D'\ $along vector
        $\overrightarrow{HI}.$ Label the translated images
        appropriately, that is, $\angle A''B''C''$ and segment $E''D''.$

    c.  How does the size of $\angle ABC$ compare to the size of
        $\angle A''B''C''$?

    d.  How does the length of segment $ED$ compare to the length of the
        segment $E''D''$?

    e.  Why do you think what you observed in parts (d) and (e) were
        true?

2.  Translate $\bigtriangleup ABC$ along vector $\overrightarrow{FG}$,
    and then translate its image along vector $\overrightarrow{JK}$. Be
    sure to label the images appropriately.

    a.  Translate Circle $A$ and Ellipse $E$ along vector
        $\overrightarrow{AB}$. Label the images appropriately.

    b.  Translate Circle $A'$ and Ellipse $E'$ along vector
        $\overrightarrow{CD}$. Label each image appropriately.

    c.  Did the size or shape of either figure change after performing
        the sequence of translations? Explain.

    of Circle $A$ along vector $\overrightarrow{CD}$. Name the vector
    that maps the image of Circle $A$ back to its original position.

6.  If a figure is translated along vector $\overrightarrow{QR}$, what
    translation takes the figure back to its original location?

Lesson Summary

- Translating a figure along one vector and then translating its image
  along another vector is an example of a sequence of transformations.

- A sequence of translations enjoys the same properties as a single
  translation. Specifically, the figures' lengths and degrees of angles
  are preserved.

- If a figure undergoes two transformations, $F\ $and $G$, and is in the
  same place it was originally, then the figure has been mapped onto
  itself.

Problem Set

1.  Sequence translations of parallelogram $ABCD$ (a quadrilateral in
    which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel) along vectors
    $\overrightarrow{HG}$ and $\overrightarrow{FE}$. Label the
    translated images.
