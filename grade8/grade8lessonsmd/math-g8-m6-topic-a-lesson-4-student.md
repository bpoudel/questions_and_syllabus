Lesson 4: Increasing and Decreasing Functions

Classwork

Graphs are useful tools in terms of representing data. They provide a
visual story, highlighting important facts that surround the
relationship between quantities.

The graph of a linear function is a line. The slope of the line can
provide useful information about the functional relationship between the
two types of quantities:

- A linear function whose graph has a positive slope is said to be an
  *increasing function.*

- A linear function whose graph has a negative slope is said to be a
  *decreasing function.*

- A linear function whose graph has a zero slope is said to be a
  *constant function.*

Exercises

Read through each of the scenarios, and choose the graph of the function
that best matches the situation. Explain the reason behind each choice.

A bathtub is filled at a constant rate of $1.75$ gallons per minute.

A bathtub is drained at a constant rate of $2.5\ $gallons per minute.

A bathtub contains $2.5$ gallons of water.

A bathtub is filled at a constant rate of $2.5$ gallons per minute.

Read through each of the scenarios, and sketch a graph of a function
that models the situation.

A messenger service charges a flat rate of $\$ 4.95$ to deliver a
package regardless of the distance to the destination.

At sea level, the air that surrounds us presses down on our bodies at
$14.7$ pounds per square inch (psi). For every $10$ meters that you dive
under water, the pressure increases by $14.7\ psi$.

The range (driving distance per charge) of an electric car varies based
on the average speed the car is driven. The initial range of the
electric car after a full charge is $400$ miles. However, the range is
reduced by $20$ miles for every $10\ mph$ increase in average speed the
car is driven.

of smartphones that are shipped to a retail store over the course of
$50$ days.

Match each part of the graph (A, B, and C) to its verbal description.
Explain the reasoning behind your choice.

Half of the factory workers went on strike, and not enough smartphones
were produced for normal shipments.

The production schedule was normal, and smartphones were shipped to the
retail store at a constant rate.

A defective electronic chip was found, and the factory had to shut down,
so no smartphones were shipped.

balance and time is modeled by the graph below.

Write a story that models the situation represented by the graph.

When is the function represented by the graph increasing? How does this
relate to your story?

When is the function represented by the graph decreasing? How does this
relate to your story?

Lesson Summary

The graph of a function can be used to help describe the relationship
between two types of quantities.

The slope of the line can provide useful information about the
functional relationship between the quantities represented by the line:

- A function whose graph has a positive slope is said to be an
  *increasing function.*

- A function whose graph has a negative slope is said to be a
  *decreasing function.*

- A function whose graph has a zero slope is said to be a *constant
  function.*

    two quantities.

    Write a story about the relationship between two quantities. Any
    quantities can be used (e.g., distance and time, money and hours,
    age and growth). Be creative. Include keywords in your story such as
    *increase* and *decrease* to describe the relationship.
