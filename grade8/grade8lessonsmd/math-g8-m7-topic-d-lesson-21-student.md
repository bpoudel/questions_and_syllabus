Exercises 1--4

1.  a.  ![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image1.png){width="2.35in"
        height="1.3in"}Write an expression that can be used to find the
        volume of the chest shown below. Explain what each part of your
        expression represents. (Assume the ends of the top portion of
        the chest are semicircular.)

    <!-- -->

    b.  What is the approximate volume of the chest shown above? Use
        $3.14$ for an approximation of $\pi$. Round your final answer to
        the tenths place.

2.  a.  ![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image2.png){width="1.4645833333333333in"
        height="2.8361111111111112in"}Write an expression for finding
        the volume of the figure, an ice cream cone and scoop, shown
        below. Explain what each part of your expression represents.
        (Assume the sphere just touches the base of the cone.)

    <!-- -->

    b.  Assuming every part of the cone can be filled with ice cream,
        what is the exact and approximate volume of the cone and scoop?
        (Recall that exact answers are left in terms of $\pi$, and
        approximate answers use $3.14$ for $\pi$). Round your
        approximate answer to the hundredths place.

3.  a.  Write an expression for finding the volume of the figure shown
        below. Explain what each part of your expression represents.

        ![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image3.png){width="1.979861111111111in"
        height="2.95in"}

    <!-- -->

    b.  Every part of the trophy shown is solid and made out of silver.
        How much silver is used to produce one trophy? Give an exact and
        approximate answer rounded to the hundredths place.

4.  Use the diagram of scoops below to answer parts (a) and (b).

    a.  Order the scoops from least to greatest in terms of their
        volumes. Each scoop is measured in inches.\
        (Assume the third scoop is hemi-spherical.)

    b.  How many of each scoop would be needed to add a half-cup of
        sugar to a cupcake mixture? (One-half cup is approximately
        $7\ {in}^{3}$.) Round your answer to a whole number of scoops.

Lesson Summary

Composite solids are figures comprising more than one solid. Volumes of
composite solids can be added as long as no parts of the solids overlap.
That is, they touch only at their boundaries.

    completely fill up the hourglass shown below? Note: $12\ m$ is the
