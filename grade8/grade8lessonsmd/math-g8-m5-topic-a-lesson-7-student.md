Lesson 7: Comparing Linear Functions and Graphs

Classwork

Exploratory Challenge/Exercises 1--4

Each of Exercises 1--4 provides information about two functions. Use
that information given to help you compare the two functions and answer
the questions about them.

1.  Alan and Margot each drive from City A to City B, a distance of
    $147$ miles. They take the same route and drive at constant speeds.
    Alan begins driving at 1:40 p.m. and arrives at City B at 4:15 p.m.
    Margot's trip from City A to City B can be described with the
    equation $y = 64x$, where $y\ $is the distance traveled in miles and
    $x$ is the time in minutes spent traveling. Who gets from City A to
    City B faster?

2.  You have recently begun researching phone billing plans. Phone
    Company A charges a flat rate of $\$ 75$ a month. A flat rate means
    that your bill will be $\$ 75$ each month with no additional costs.
    The billing plan for Phone Company B is a linear function of the
    number of texts that you send that month. That is, the total cost of
    the bill changes each month depending on how many texts you send.
    The table below represents some inputs and the corresponding outputs
    that the function assigns.

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Input                             | Output                           |
|                                   |                                  |
| (number of texts)                 | (cost of bill in dollars)        |
+===================================+==================================+
| $$50$$                            | $$50$$                           |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| $$150$$                           | $$60$$                           |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| $$200$$                           | $$65$$                           |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| $$500$$                           | $$95$$                           |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

At what number of texts would the bill from each phone plan be the same?
At what number of texts is Phone Company A the better choice? At what
number of texts is Phone Company B the better choice?

3.  The function that gives the volume of water, $y$, that flows from
    Faucet A in gallons during $x$ minutes is a linear function with the
    graph shown. Faucet B's water flow can be described by the equation
    $y = \frac{5}{6}x$, where $y$ is the volume of water in gallons that
    flows from the faucet during $x$ minutes. Assume the flow of water
    from each faucet is constant. Which faucet has a faster rate of flow
    of water? Each faucet is being used to fill a tub with a volume of
    $50$ gallons. How long will it take each faucet to fill its tub? How
    do you know?

    Suppose the tub being filled by Faucet A already had $15$ gallons of
    water in it, and the tub being filled by Faucet B started empty. If
    now both faucets are turned on at the same time, which faucet will
    fill its tub fastest?

4.  Two people, Adam and Bianca, are competing to see who can save the
    most money in one month. Use the table and the graph below to
    determine who will save the most money at the end of the month.
    State how much money each person had at the start of the
    competition. (Assume each is following a linear function in his or
    her saving habit.)

    Adam's Savings:

5.  The local park needs to replace an existing fence that is 6 feet
    high. Fence Company A charges $\$ 7,000$ for building materials and
    $\$ 200$ per foot for the length of the fence. Fence Company B
    charges are based solely on the length of the fence. That is, the
    total cost of the six-foot high fence will depend on how long the
    fence is. The table below represents some inputs and their
    corresponding outputs that the cost function for Fence Company B
    assigns. It is a linear function.

a.  Which company charges a higher rate per foot of fencing? How do you
    know?

b.  At what number of the length of the fence would the cost from each
    fence company be the same? What will the cost be when the companies
    charge the same amount? If the fence you need were $190$ feet in
    length, which company would be a better choice?

7.  A train is traveling from City A to City B, a distance of $320$
    miles. The graph below shows the number of miles, $y$, the train
    travels as a function of the number of hours, $x$, that have passed
    on its journey. The train travels at a constant speed for the first
    four hours of its journey and then slows down to a constant speed of
    48 miles per hour for the remainder of its journey.

    ![](.\grade8lessonsmd\media/media/image4.png){width="2.9in"

    a.  How long will it take the train to reach its destination?

    b.  If the train had not slowed down after $4$ hours, how long would
        it have taken to reach its destination?

    c.  Suppose after $4$ hours, the train increased its constant speed.
        How fast would the train have to travel to complete the
        destination in $1.5$ hours?

8.  a.  A hose is used to fill up a $1,200$ gallon water truck. Water
        flows from the hose at a constant rate. After $10$ minutes,
        there are $65$ gallons of water in the truck. After
        $15\ $minutes, there are $82$ gallons of water in the truck. How
        long will it take to fill up the water truck? Was the tank
        initially empty?

    b.  The driver of the truck realizes that something is wrong with
        the hose he is using. After $30$ minutes, he shuts off the hose
        and tries a different hose. The second hose flows at a constant
        rate of $18$ gallons per minute. How long now does it take to
        fill up the truck?
