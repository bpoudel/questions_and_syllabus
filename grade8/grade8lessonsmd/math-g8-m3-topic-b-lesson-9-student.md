Lesson 9: Basic Properties of Similarity

Classwork

Exploratory Challenge 1

The goal is to show that if $\bigtriangleup ABC$ is similar to
$\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$, then $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ is similar to
$\bigtriangleup ABC$. Symbolically, if $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim 
 \bigtriangleup A'B'C'$, then
$\bigtriangleup A'B'C' \sim \bigtriangleup ABC$.

a.  First, determine whether or not $\bigtriangleup ABC$ is in fact
    similar to $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$. (If it isn't, then no further
    work needs to be done.) Use a protractor to verify that the
    corresponding angles are congruent and that the ratios of the
    corresponding sides are equal to some scale factor.

b.  Describe the sequence of dilation followed by a congruence that
    proves $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A'B'C'$.

c.  Describe the sequence of dilation followed by a congruence that
    proves $\bigtriangleup A'B'C' \sim \bigtriangleup ABC$.

d.  Is it true that $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ and
    $\bigtriangleup A'B'C' \sim \bigtriangleup ABC$? Why do you think
    this is so?

Exploratory Challenge 2

The goal is to show that if $\bigtriangleup ABC$ is similar to
$\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ and $\bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ is similar to
$\bigtriangleup A''B''C''$, then $\bigtriangleup ABC$ is similar to\
$\bigtriangleup A^{''}B^{''}C^{''}$. Symbolically, if
$\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A'B'C'$ and
$\bigtriangleup A'B'C' \sim \bigtriangleup A^{''}B^{''}C^{''}$, then
$\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A^{''}B^{''}C^{''}$.

a.  Describe the similarity that proves
    $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A'B'C'$.

e.  Describe the similarity that proves
    $\bigtriangleup A'B'C' \sim \bigtriangleup A^{''}B^{''}C^{''}$.

f.  Verify that, in fact,
    $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A''B^{''}C^{''}$ by checking
    corresponding angles and corresponding side lengths. Then, describe
    the sequence that would prove the similarity
    $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A^{''}B^{''}C^{''}$.

g.  Is it true that if $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A'B'C'$
    and $\bigtriangleup A'B'C' \sim \bigtriangleup A''B''C''$, then
    $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A''B''C''$? Why do you think
    this is so?

Lesson Summary

Similarity is a symmetric relation. That means that if one figure is
similar to another, $S\sim S'$, then we can be sure that $S'\sim S$.

Similarity is a transitive relation. That means that if we are given two
similar figures, $S\sim T$, and another statement about $T\sim U$, then
we also know that $S\sim U$.

Problem Set

1.  Would a dilation alone be enough to show that similarity is
    symmetric? That is, would a dilation alone prove that if
    $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A'B'C'$, then
    $\bigtriangleup A'B'C' \sim \bigtriangleup ABC$? Consider the two
    examples below.

    a.  Given $\bigtriangleup ABC \sim \bigtriangleup A'B'C'$, is a
        dilation enough to show that
        $\bigtriangleup A'B'C' \sim \bigtriangleup ABC$? Explain.
