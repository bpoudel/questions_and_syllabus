Introductory: These are the very first skills in a new topic or unit. They involve introducing basic definitions, identifying fundamental components, and working with simple examples. The focus is on initial exposure and recognition. (e.g., Identifying Place Value Names).

Conceptual: These skills focus on understanding the idea behind a mathematical concept or process. They often involve visualization, explanation, or grasping the 'why' rather than just the 'how'. (e.g., Understanding Decimal Rounding, Conceptual Regrouping).

Procedural: These skills involve learning and executing a specific set of steps or an algorithm to solve a problem or perform a calculation. Accuracy and following the steps are key. (e.g., The standard algorithm for Rounding Decimals).

Application: These skills require students to use the concepts and procedures they've learned to solve problems presented in context, usually word problems. This involves reading comprehension, identifying the relevant math, and applying the correct skill. (e.g., Rounding Decimals Word Problems, Applying Decimal Comparison in Context).

Core: This indicates a central, fundamental skill within the unit that is essential for mastery of the topic. It often builds directly on introductory skills and is necessary for subsequent, more complex skills. (e.g., Comparing Decimals, The main Rounding procedure).

Reinforcement: These skills strengthen understanding of previously introduced concepts, often by applying them in a slightly different way or adding a layer of complexity that solidifies the initial learning. (e.g., Understanding Digit Value reinforces Place Names; Understanding Place Value Relationships reinforces basic place value).

Synthesis: These skills require students to combine multiple concepts or procedures learned throughout the unit (or from prior units) to solve a problem or complete a task. It involves putting pieces together. (e.g., Comparing Decimals in Different Forms requires knowledge of forms and comparison strategies).
